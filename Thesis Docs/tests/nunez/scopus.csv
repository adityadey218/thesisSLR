The Internet is one of the most used information sources for planning tourism trips. However, the level of accessibility of information disseminated by the tourism industry through websites is still very low. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the existence of diversity in Web accessibility in the tourism industry. METHODS: A systematic literature review method was used for the identification, selection, and evaluation of the published research on Web accessibility in the tourism industry. A set of 40 papers obtained from relevant scientific databases, and complemented with a snowballing effect, was synthesized and analyzed. RESULTS: Low levels of diversity of Web accessibility were found in the different tourism activities analyzed. The majority of studies published in this field are relatively recent and both manual and automated methods were employed. Web accessibility failures were mainly related to lack of connectivity with assistive technologies, complex layout, and navigation difficulties. CONCLUSION: The results obtained in this systematic literature review provide important contributions to increase knowledge of Web accessibility in the tourism industry. Moreover, practical and theoretical contributions can help Web developers creating more accessible tourism websites.  © 2021-IOS Press. All rights reserved.",Review,Final,Scopus

Ensuring the municipal website is accessible to all citizens needs to be a top priority on the public digital marketing to-do list. Specifically, when we are in the presence of citizens who suffer from a specific impairment or technical hindrance, local governments have to provide them with equal access to their services. Starting from an analysis of the generic theoretical and legislative framework to which each municipality website must adhere, the paper investigates accessibility issues of local government websites taking into account specifically Italy's case. The Italian federal law, which is also known as the Stanca Act, aims to support access to information technologies for the disabled and addresses accessibility considerations in Italy. For ensuring that Italian government websites meet specific accessibility requirements, in this paper, we propose an evaluation strategy defined by an analysis of two validators: AChecker and VaMolà. 7,713 homepages were evaluated against WCAG 2.0 and Stanca Law recommendations. The analysis of results reveals relatively low web accessibility of municipal websites but highlights how to solve several of them is not a complex task also for non-technical users. For this reason, we developed a web application that allows municipality personnel to change the code of the homepage of a given municipality. All this can be made possible through the implementation of textual suggestions and the correct positional identification of the error within the HTML code of the page in question. Finally, the paper gives some directions on how to adapt the presented methodology for checking accessibility issues of local government websites of other countries. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Article,Final,Scopus

Usability Inspection Methods (UIMs) can be applied to evaluate and measure the usability. The current research in the fields of Web Accessibility and Human –Computer Interaction (HCI) is in need of additional UIMs that can be applied to also measure the accessibility, in addition to the usability alone. In this article, a novel UIM in the form of a heuristic evaluation is presented. The heuristic evaluation aims to support HCI experts and Web developers in designing and evaluating websites that provide positive user experiences to users who are deaf. This article discusses the development of the Heuristic Evaluation for Deaf Web User Experience (HE4DWUX). Following an iteration cycle, version 2 of the HE4DWUX is presented in Appendix A. An existing three-phase process to develop heuristics for specific application domains was applied to construct the HE4DWUX. The outcome of this research is 12 heuristics, with each containing its own set of checklist items to operationalize its applicability in measuring the Web user experience for users who are deaf. The heuristics and their checklist items can identify important aspects of design that will impact the Web user experience for this particular user group. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Article,Final,Scopus

To optimise the accessibility evaluation process, we aim to reduce the number of pages auditors must review by employing statistically representative pages, reducing a site of thousands of pages to a manageable review of archetypal pages. Our paper focuses on representativeness, one of six proposed metrics that form our methodology, to address the limitations we have identified with the W3C Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM). These include the evaluative scope, the non-probabilistic sampling approach, and the potential for bias within the selected sample. Representativeness, in particular, is a metric to assess the quality and coverage of sampling. To measure this, we systematically evaluate five web page representations with a website of 388 pages, including tags, structure, the DOM tree, content, and a mixture of structure and content. Our findings highlight the importance of including structural components in representations. We validate our conclusions using the same methodology for three additional random sites of 500 pages. As an exclusive attribute, we find that features derived from web content are suboptimal and can lead to lower quality and more disparate clustering for optimised accessibility evaluation. © 2023 Owner/Author.",Conference paper,Final,Scopus

The results reveal significant accessibility violations in 6 of 10 websites, despite the implementation of regulatory frameworks since 2013. The most common violations include an absence of alternative text and very low contrast. Other frequent violations are a lack of keyboard support, lengthy navigation, empty buttons, missing form labels, empty links, and empty headings. These issues are considered critical and need to be addressed urgently because incorrect design elements and navigation problems can cause confusion and loss of control for users, particularly those relying on screen readers.

Additionally, some programs have created websites to provide information about their fellowship program. There has been limited research on the amount and breadth of information provided by these different resources. PURPOSE: To assess and compare the scope of information provided by the North American Spine Society (NASS) fellowship directory and individual fellowship program websites. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Web Content Accessibility Study. PATIENT SAMPLE: There were no patient data used in this study. All reported data were accessed from public websites and the NASS fellowship directory (August 2022 fellowships). OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures were reported as the presence or lack thereof of 22 topics pertaining to the specifics of each individual spine fellowship program on both the NASS fellowship directory and individual fellowship program websites. METHODS: The NASS fellowship directory (August 2022 fellowships) and individual program websites were evaluated by two independent reviewers. Program websites were identified via Google search with a systematic protocol. Within each platform, the availability of various data were recorded. Twenty-four different data points were assessed for each program and were categorized into four main categories—general program information, fellow profiles, clinical roles, and nonclinical roles of the fellow. Chi-squared tests were used to compare differences in the availability of specific data provided by the NASS fellowship directory and individual program websites. RESULTS: Seventy-four fellowship programs were identified. The NASS fellowship directory was more likely to provide information about the application process, a description of the program, fellow salary, faculty members, case descriptions, and research requirements (p<.05). The program websites were more likely to provide information about current and previous fellows—including a list of current fellow(s), their education/training, and a list of the previous fellows and their job choice (p<.05). Program websites were also more likely to discuss rotation schedules, clinic expectations, research opportunities, journal club, institutional meetings, sponsored national meetings, and current/previous research (p<.05). However, certain information, including specific clinical responsibilities (eg, rotation schedule, call expectations, clinic expectations) and the profiles of current and previous fellows, were not well represented on either platform. CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences in the type of information provided by the NASS fellowship directory and program websites. Furthermore, there were key pieces of information that were not well represented on either platform. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Article,Final,Scopus

These websites need to be accessible to people with visual impairments like color blindness. Thus, the design of such websites needs to follow certain web accessibility guidelines considering the accessibility for the colorblind. In this study, the authors have proposed a novel heuristic method to evaluate the compliance to the web accessibility guidelines provided by WCAG through a web accessibility score. This score is arrived at by evaluating the web design compliance to these mentioned guidelines based on a well-defined set of heuristics. As part of the experiment, websites from four categories were evaluated using the proposed method and the web accessibility score of the websites was arrived at with respect to color blindness disability. The results confirm the applicability of the proposed method to evaluate the websites for accessibility to colorblind people. The important research contributions are as follows: (a) a web accessibility score that helps to quantify the compliance to WCAG guidelines for color blindness by a web site; (b) a compilation of WCAG guidelines for web designers to design websites complying to accessibility for colorblind; (c) the proposed novel method would be further useful to check web accessibility compliance for users with other disabilities and give an indication of inclusivity for them; and (d) the novel heuristic method includes tool evaluation and manual observation ensuring maximum coverage for web accessibility guidelines. This quantification of web accessibility can support web accessibility experts for an opinion and help in providing a score for measuring web accessibility. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,Article in press,Scopus

Mobile accessibility involves the process of making mobile applications more inclusive for individuals with disabilities using mobile devices. This paper investigates the strong need for effective methodologies to evaluate the accessibility of mobile applications, particularly with the recent implementation of the Web Accessibility Directive in Europe. By reviewing existing research, analyzing monitoring reports from European Union Member States, and conducting interviews with mobile accessibility evaluators, this study identifies limitations in current evaluation methodologies and provides some insights into the challenges faced by evaluators. The findings reveal that there is no universally adopted methodology for evaluating the accessibility of mobile applications. Evaluators either adapt existing methodologies designed for web accessibility or develop their own approaches. The absence of specific guidelines for mobile accessibility poses a challenge, with evaluators often having to interpret web-focused documents. The lack of comprehensive automated tools for mobile accessibility evaluation further complicates the process. Through this research, it is anticipated that improvements in mobile application accessibility evaluations will contribute to creating more inclusive mobile experiences for all individuals. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",Conference paper,Final,Scopus

Additionally, due to the polysemy present in the language, the system provides definitions for complex words, which are disambiguated by a rule-based method supported by a state-of-the-art embedding resource. This system is integrated into a web system that provides an easy way to improve the readability and comprehension of Spanish texts. The results obtained are satisfactory; in the CWI task, better results were obtained than with other systems that used the same dataset. The SG/SS task results are comparable to similar works in the English language and provide a solid starting point to improve this task for the Spanish language. Finally, the results of the disambiguation process evaluation were good when evaluated by a linguistic expert. These findings represent an additional advancement in the lexical simplification of texts in Spanish and in a generic domain using easy-to-read resources, among others, to provide systematic support to compliance with accessibility guidelines. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,Final,Scopus

The objectives of the test were a) to validate a set of heuristic indicators for the evaluation of the accessibility of statistical charts presented in a previous work [7]; b) to identify new barriers and preferences for users with low vision in the access and use of this content not previously contemplated. 12 users were tested, with a variety of conditions associated with low vision: low visual acuity (6 users), reduced central vision (2 users), reduced peripheral vision (2 users), blurry vision (1 user), sensitivity to light (3 users), Nystagmus (2 users) and color vision deficiency (CVD) (4 users). From a quantitative standpoint, accessible versions of charts were more efficient, effective, and satisfactory. From a qualitative point of view, results verify the relevance of heuristics H2, Legend; H3, Axes; H6, Data source (as data table); H10, Safe colors; H11, Contrast; H12, Legibility; H13, Image quality; H14, Resize; H16, Focus visible; H17, Independent navigation; related to the proposed tasks. As new observations, tooltips were highly valued by all users, but their implementation must be improved to avoid covering up significant parts of the charts when displayed. The data table has also been frequently used by all users, especially in the non-accessible versions, allowing them to carry out tasks more efficiently. The position and size of the legend can be a significant barrier if it is too small or appears in an unusual position. Finally, despite the limitations related to color perception, users prefer color graphics to black and white, so, to target all profiles, it is necessary to redundantly encode categories with colors and patterns as well.  © 2022 ACM.",Conference paper,Final,Scopus

Following this evolution, it is crucial that its content allows access to the different user's profiles. Older adults (age 60+) are users who typically have limited capacities due to ageing process and they have encountered difficulties in interacting with websites. Several accessibility and usability issues still have to be solved, despite the legislation and guidelines established for the development of accessible and usable web content. In particular, little attention has been devoted to the difficulties faced by older adults because most websites are not designed with these users in mind. This paper addresses the development of a checklist, a support to web accessibility and usability evaluations for the older adults profile and its validation. The checklist was elaborated from analysis of the state of the art, based on a literature review. During the checklist development we investigated the main barriers faced by older adults in web interaction. We conclude by highlighting the need for more studies on web interaction by older people and proposing new strategies for future research. © 2018 ACM.",Conference paper,Final,Scopus

This paper presents the design, implementation, and validation of a creative adaptive web-based environment to support deafblind individuals in their web accessibility and life-long learning processes. This system adapts to deafblind users’ degree of loss of senses. It retrieves the web page content using dumbing of DOM (Document Object Model) technique and converts the retrieved content into an appropriate format. If the user can hear, the text is transformed into speech. If they have some sight sense, the content is transformed to screen-based Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) presentation technique. However, if the user has an entirely dual sensory loss, the web page content is transformed into a tactile presentation technique (Moon code or Braille) that can be printed with a special embosser printer on swelled paper or touched using a display device. In the tests performed to deafblind users, this system obtained about 85% user satisfaction. This novel adaptable system that has been tested with users offers the benefit of easing at least some of the daily challenges faced by these individuals and of aiding them in web accessibility and lifelong learning content. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Conference paper,Final,Scopus

Therefore, this research aims to create a process model for continuous web accessibility testing by adapting and customizing three methodologies: Deming cycle (Plan, Do, Check, Act), Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM), and Total Quality Management. The process model is composed of four phases. The first phase (Plan) allows defining the accessibility problem, its importance, and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) against which it will be evaluated. In addition, determine the current situation of the websites, the potential causes of accessibility problems, classify the success criteria by principles, guidelines, and levels of conformity, to elaborate the solution plan and the action plan. The second phase (Do) allows the execution of the action plan to correct the accessibility problems. In this phase, we should perform continuous testing with automatic evaluation tools, end-users, and experts to corroborate that the changes have had an effect. The third phase (Check) allows measuring compliance and non-compliance with the defined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). This phase also explains the reasons for non-compliance. The fourth and last phase (Act) documents the solutions learned for inclusion in future developments. This research results in the process model for continuous web accessibility and its testing through a case study to corroborate its functionality and applicability. In conclusion, the proposed model allows continuous evaluation, monitoring, and feedback on compliance with accessibility rules, policies, and standards on websites with automatic evaluation tools, end-users, and experts.

It is therefore becoming increasingly essential that the Web must be accessible to all people to provide equal access and equal opportunity. This is specifically more important for people with various kind of disabilities. Several initiatives such as development of Web accessibility guidelines, tools and technologies have been undertaken to make the Web usable for people with different disabilities. However, only a handful of them are aimed at people with Severe Speech and Motor Impairment (SSMI). This paper aims to present a Web browsing interface for people with severe speech and motor impairment. Design/methodology/approach: The browser allows easy dissemination of information through World Wide Web for people with SSMI. The browser is augmented with both automatic as well as manual scanning mechanisms through which a motor disorder person can access the browser graphical user interface (GUI). Further, the browser provides an intelligent content scanning mechanism through which the Web contents can be accessed with less time and cognitive effort. Along with the desktop version, WebSanyog is successfully ported on Android-based tablets to make the system portable. Findings: The system has been exhaustively field tested by people with SSMI. The browser has been deployed at the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy (IICP), Kolkata. The performance of the browser has been measured in terms of three parameters: The Task execution time (TET); Error rates analysis (ER); and Overall usability score by the subject. The evaluation results suggests that the proposed Web browsing interface is effective in terms of task execution time, cognitive effort and overall user satisfaction. Originality/value: The browser GUI is integrated with an automatic scanning mechanism as an alternate way to access and navigate through Web pages, instead of using keyboard and mouse. The browser provides novel content access mechanisms that makes navigating through Web page contents like links, images and embedded videos easier and faster. To facilitate text entry, the browser provides two different options, namely, the predictive virtual scanning keyboard and a novel icon-based query entry scheme that allows generating search queries through the selection of multiple icons. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,Final,Scopus

The digital library is expected to serve more diverse and challenging users’ requirements, making accessibility the prominent attribute. Despite its significance, many digital library systems fail to address accessibility accordingly. This study aims to examine accessibility problems in the digital library system in higher education, i.e., Universitas Airlangga’s e-library, and develop a solution based on the design thinking methodology. The questionnaire on the empathize phase gathered 25 respondents’ perceptions about the current library website. The identified major accessibility requirements are unmatched and incomplete library description on the front page, complex and unclear navigation menu, low contrast between the text and background image—making reading more difficult, especially for users with low vision, the absence of the first heading, and unspecified website language. The solutions generated during the Ideation phase corresponded to the list of identified requirements. The prototype implements these solutions by combining them with the Web Content Accessibility Design 2.0 standard. The evaluation results signify the accessibility progress in the redesigned library website prototype. The average user rating increased from 3 on the current library website to 4.63 on the redesigned version, and the task completion rate reached 92.86%. In addition, the accessibility tests using WAVE and AxeDev Tools exhibit major improvements in contrast error and total accessibility issues. Findings from this study are helpful for system developers, user interface/user experience designers, and libraries in formulating an accessible digital library system.

The purpose for undertaking such an analysis is to provide a quasi-indicator of inclusive organizational practice for online accessibility for both destination managers and their accessible tourism consumers–domestic and overseas people with disability visiting the websites. Method: The official tourism websites of 210 countries included in the latest World Tourism Organization report were analyzed. A website accessibility evaluation tool (website accessible test) was used in the analysis, according to AA and AAA levels of conformance to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 requirements. Results: Different patterns compliance to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 were established for the clusters, which were rather similar for both AA and AAA conformance levels. The main issues in the least accessible websites were also identified, mainly focused on the following guidelines: navigable, compatible, adaptability, text alternatives and also referred to other assistive technologies. Conclusions: Once the main issues were established several alternatives are suggested to address them, such as implementing more prescriptive laws and regulations, complying with mandatory benchmark standards and/or having external agencies audit website designs. However, in addition to using benchmark standards, efforts to improve this situation should also be made by programmers, who should also rely on preexistent experiences and develop more dynamic knowledge.

Failures in Web accessibility create exclusion barriers in groups of people. There are several studies on accessibility in which the guidelines suggested by Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 were not adequately applied. This study describes the web accessibility problems identified in 22 hospital websites according to the Webometrics ranking. In the evaluation process, a framework was applied to help in the evaluation of the websites proposed by the World Wide Web Consortium. In this work, several hospital websites and the level of accessibility were validated, the Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology was applied to identify the ease with which a website can be accessed in accordance with WCAG 2.0 standards; of the sites evaluated, the type of patterns most violated in the analysis was the name, role, and value, which represents 13.4% followed by the guidelines of content, information and relationships without text with 12.8%.

On their websites, universities publish their academic offerings, their mission, their vision, their academic objectives, their achievements, their regulations, their news and all their university work. Hence, the importance of university websites is accessible. The accessibility of university websites has been evaluated several times in the past, but there is no work that has summarized all the evaluations performed to provide a general overview of the situation. Therefore, in this research we have performed a systematic literature review (SLR) to consolidate, analyze, synthesize and interpret the accessibility results of university websites published in 42 papers that have been selected for this study. The methodology used in this SLR was that proposed in Kitchenham’s guidelines, which includes three stages: planning the review, conducting the review and reporting the review. The results present the analysis and synthesis of the evaluations of 9,140 universities in 67 countries. Of these, 38,416 web pages, 91,421 YouTube videos and 28,395 PDF documents were evaluated. Manual methods, methods with automatic tools and the combination of both methods were used for the evaluation. Most websites were evaluated using the ISO/IEC 40500:2012 and Section 508 standards. The accessibility guidelines most commonly violated in the evaluations were: adaptable, compatible, distinguishable, input assistance, keyboard accessible, navigable, predictable, readable and text alternatives. In conclusion, the university websites, YouTube videos and PDF documents analyzed in the 42 papers present important accessibility problems.

Without these supporting features, navigating modern webpages that typically contain thousands of HTML elements in their DOMs, is both tedious and cumbersome for blind screen-reader users. Existing approaches to improve non-visual navigation efficiency typically propose 'one-size-fits-all' solutions that do not accommodate the personal needs and preferences of screen-reader users. To fill this void, in this paper, we present sTag, a browser extension embodying a semi-automatic method that enables users to easily create their own Table Of Contents (TOC) for any webpage by simply 'tagging' their preferred 'semantically-meaningful' segments (e.g., search results, filter options, forms, menus, etc.) while navigating the webpage. This way, all subsequent accesses to these segments can be made via the generated TOC that is made instantly accessible via a special shortcut or a repurposed mouse/touchpad action. As tags in sTag are attached to the abstract semantic segments instead of actual DOM nodes in the webpage, sTag can automatically generate equivalent TOCs for other similar webpages, without requiring the users to duplicate their tagging efforts from scratch in these webpages. An evaluation with 15 blind screen-reader users revealed that sTag significantly reduced the content-navigation time and effort compared to those with a state-of-the-art solution. © 2021 ACM.",Conference paper,Final,Scopus

Addressing this issue, we develop a new crowdsourcing-based Web accessibility evaluation system with two novel decision strategies, golden set strategy and time-based golden set strategy. These strategies enable the generation of task results with high accuracy synthesized from micro-tasks solved by workers with heterogeneous expertise.

This paper proposes a personalization approach that considers detailed observational data from usage and generates user interface adjustments (pieces of JavaScript code) from a set of selector-template pairs. Selectors are regular expressions used to identify patterns in event streams and templates are adjustments skeletons, referring user interface elements identified by the selectors. The approach supports continuous personalization of websites aiming to reduce the number of accessibility barriers and usability problems.

The main factors that pose barriers to communication and interaction were identified. Practical implications: The paper encourages smart tourism destinations to overcome the challenge of matching both dimensions of accessibility to obtain barrier-free information to ensure cities are inclusive and sustainable in line with Agenda 2030 (sustainable development goal [SDG] 11). Originality/value: The concept of tourism for all receives special attention in the sector, and this notion is reflected in the UN SDGs. However, accessibility has not been extensively analyzed in relation to the cohesion between the digital and the physical dimension. Tourism research tends to focus on accessible experiences within destinations. This paper introduces a new insight into the key issue of digital accessibility, which can promote destination choice and influence the tourism experience. © 2022, Elena Fernández-Díaz, Carmen Jambrino-Maldonado, Patricia P.

This study identified the lack of clear policies and methods for assessing accessibility in apps as a significant challenge for web accessibility experts. On the other hand, the heuristic evaluation concept proposed by Nielsen and Molich is an inspection method based on the evaluation of an interactive system. To reduce accessibility barriers, in this research we propose a heuristic method based on Brajnik’s Barrier Walkthrough. The method helps to propose some improvements to evaluate accessibility in mobile applications between a heuristic method and the Web Content Accessibility Guide 2.1. As a case study, we applied this evaluation to users with low vision who use mobile applications under the Android operating system that helps users monitor the air we breathe.

The study aims to assess the accessibility of Indian museum websites in terms of their severity. Design/methodology/approach: The accessibility evaluation of 11 Indian museum websites was conducted using Siteimprove Accessibility Checker (SAC), an automated website testing tool. Findings: The study results indicate that the mean conformance score for the Indian museum websites for level A was 19.27, while for level AA and AAA, it came out to be 2.63 and 4.09, respectively, with the highest severity scores for error (16.3) followed by review (5.81) criteria and warning (3.81). The major findings indicate that the websites of Indian museums poorly conform to web accessibility guidelines. Practical implications: The study's findings will assist the museum's website creators, managers and administrators in determining the level of conformity as per standard accessibility guidelines helping them make strategic decisions to improve the accessibility. Originality/value: Most of the studies available in the field of website accessibility range from the web accessibility of educational institutions, tourism websites, municipal websites and ministerial websites, but there are very few studies investigating the accessibility of museum websites. A quantitative evaluation of different aspects of accessibility was conducted in the study, which can pave the way for the better design of web sites by addressing deficiencies. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,Article in press,Scopus

Methodology: In step 1, a bibliographic research was performed in books and journals and also a documentary research by laws, decrees and government websites on accessibility. In stage 2, the 11 Federal Universities of the State of Minas Gerais were selected as a sample, where the number of students enrolled was requested, by e-mail and Fala.BR platform, as well as the number of students who declare themselves with some type of disability. In stage 3, an automatic web accessibility assessment was performed on the library websites of the 11 institutions of the sample using the Website Accessibility Simulator Assistant (ASES) e; heuristic assessment of Web accessibility by means of accessibility guidelines creating, at the end of the heuristic evaluation, a list of seven elements already implemented or that could be implemented on the libraries' websites, namely: 1) accessibility description; 2) jump menu; 3) contrast; 4) font size; 5) keyboard navigation; 6) Vlibras and; 7) text audio. Results: The survey indicated a low percentage of People with Disabilities enrolled in Minas Gerais universities, when compared to the 2010 Census. However, this is no reason for universities to stop improving web accessibility features on their respective websites. On the contrary, universities can develop accessible resources that meet different needs/levels of People with Disabilities. Conclusion: The combination of evaluation techniques, automatic and heuristic are fundamental for a more complete analysis of Web accessibility. © 2021 Universidade Estadual de Campinas.

It ensures equality for all of them and the opportunity to participate in the society. This concept is also crucial in the process of designing and developing software. The research was conducted with the use of four services, three of them were implemented for the purpose of this study. Two of them took into consideration the principles of universal design, while the others did not. The aim of the study was verification of the level of usability and accessibility of services by means of three independent methods: the LUT (Lublin University of Technology) checklist, an assessment taking into account WCAG 2.0 (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards using the automatic WAVE evaluation tool (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool) and a device allowing to track the movement of the eye while performing various tasks on websites. The websites were assessed by twenty experts in the field of creating web application interfaces, using the LUT checklist. The time to the first fixation (TTFF) that it took respondents to look at specific website elements was measured using the eye tracker device and iMotions software. All websites were checked by means of the WAVE tool to detect irregularities and non-compliance with universal design standards. The analysis performed clearly indicated that websites that follow the universal design guidelines were more useful, intuitive and accessible for users. It might be concluded that interfaces allow to find necessary information and perform desired actions in a shorter time when prepared in accordance with the principles of universal design. © 2022, Polish Association for Knowledge Promotion.

Thus, the need for these websites to be accessible to all individuals, including those with some sort of disability, is essential. The goal of the present research has been to analyze 48 of the leading Spanish public hospitals' website homepages to assess their levels of compliance with accessibility and readability guidelines. This perspective has allowed us to determine exactly how accessible health information and hospital services are for citizens. In order to analyze accessibility, a qualitative method based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 standard was used. This method combined manual code inspections with the use of both accessibility tools and automatic tools as validators. Furthermore, a quantitative method, by means of a readability metric, was used to analyze readability of the texts of the analyzed websites. The findings revealed that many of the analyzed websites violated critical accessibility guidelines. In addition, several accessibility errors were identified, such as images without any textual description and a lack of information regarding the purpose of the links. These deficiencies have the greatest impact on accessing websites by people with disabilities. Related to the results of the readability of the texts on hospital webpages, it was found that, in general, they are somewhat difficult to understand by most people. © 2022 ACM.",Conference paper,Final,Scopus

These practices are part of corporate sustainability actions. Purpose of the paper: To assess compliance with the principles of the social inclusion of disabled users, the study investigates the adoption of accessibility requirements on the sustainable firms’ corporate websites. Methodology: A content analysis was conducted to identify the application of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) guidelines to the websites of 311 firms classified in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index 2018. Data were collected from July to December 2019. Findings: Results show that most corporate websites are poorly compliant with the accessibility guidelines, although some sectoral and geographic differences emerge. The study shows that compliance with W3C standards is associated with both the belonging to different business activities and the geographical origin of companies. Research limits: The adoption of the content analysis method implies the typical limits associated with the subjective evaluation of researchers. The sample of firms examined may be expanded in future investigations, in compliance with the equitable distribution of companies regarding sectors and geographical areas. Practical implications: Results allow managers and consultants of corporate digital communications to evaluate and improve corporate performance relating to accessibility practices on websites. Access to digital content and services is an indispensable requirement for implementing sustainability actions, capable of increasing social legitimacy and corporate reputation and developing disabled users’ engagement. Originality of the paper: The study constitutes a first step in a line of research not yet investigated.

Web accessibility becomes an important aspect of accessing a web that is set in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standard. However, so many websites that have not implemented the WCAG standard. Some of the reasons are the length of time to learn about it and difficult to understand. Therefore, many studies have been done to improve this web accessibility. The solution offered by previous researchers still uses manual code fixes. The problem that arises is time-consuming code changes because there are many web pages need to fix. The automated refactoring method is believed to be able to solve the problem. We develop a method and tool that can improve web accessibility automatically (automated refactoring), also improve the accessibility faster than refactoring manually. The implementation of Automatically is done by modifying the existing automated evaluation tool, namely HTML Code Sniffer and implementing 40 techniques from WCAG standard that can be automated. From the functional testing performed, 5 websites chosen to be tested successfully to reduce errors in the source code. Comparison of manual refactoring methods and Automatically tools is also conducted to 5 websites. Total changes or parameters performed using manual refactoring is more than using Automatically.

While the digital revolution has an impact on online services and resources, the website plays a valuable tool in library services. Users can access many useful features when visiting the library without physical presence. The purposes of libraries in academic institutions are not different. Libraries disseminate information and media within the internal databases and connect users to other external sources and show the results to all academic persons and general interests. While traditional library remains in the services, the additional supports have been addressed to ensure that all users have equal access. Not only the ordinary persons can make use of the library, but also the people with disabilities are the stakeholder. This research examined web accessibility compliance to WCAG 2.0 level A of the 23 Thai academic libraries on most common pages, which were home, book loan service information, and e-databases pages. Each webpage was assessed using multiple tools and manual check and made a comparison of the success criteria with 25 checkpoints. The research approach was carried out following the Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology. The finding results were found that people with disabilities could have a barrier to access to materials available on the academic libraries’ websites. Non-text content was the most critical barrier. While AChecker could identify the most violation, an additional approach to increase the accuracy is recommended. Manual check also needs a professional person to ensure accurate and robust judgment for better web accessibility. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Conference paper,Final,Scopus

This paper presents the accessibility evaluation of ePHoRt, a web platform that aims to improve the rehabilitation of patients after a total or partial hip replacement operation known as arthroplasty. The accessibility method is based on the Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology 1.0 that considers the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1. We evaluate first the accessibility of ePHoRt using the WAVE automatic tool. Then, manual inspection was performed. Based on the results, we present recommendations to ensure that the application is accessible and inclusive.

Users with disabilities may find it difficult to use many websites and platforms due to technical barriers. To improve access to websites, international organisations like International Organization for Standardization (ISO), European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), or World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) develop web accessibility standards and guidelines, which provide an introduction to accessibility issues. By following some basic recommendations, any website and platform can become a good environment for exchanging information to digitally include people with disabilities. Due to the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) recent 5 years and its application in various sectors (e.g., game industry, e-commerce, facial recognition systems, agriculture, financial and economic sectors, cyber security, education, etc.), this also implies its application to help people with special needs to ensure digital accessibility. In this regard, the aim of this paper is related to proposing a method for heuristic evaluation of AI-powered web accessibility assistants. The method was tested using AI-powered accessibility assistants. The paper’s objectives that meet its purpose and research questions are: (1) review of artificial intelligence application in web accessibility practices; (2) evaluation of selected tools based on the proposed method to prove its applicability. The method has been tested by heuristic evaluation of AI-powered accessibility assistants for websites. Web accessibility, measured in number of errors and alerts by applying WAVE tool, was compared before and after accessibility assistants were enabled. © The Author(s) 2023.",Article,Final,Scopus

Although these tools can only check the compliance with some of the many success criteria of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, they can assist quality assurance personnel, web administrators and web authors to discover hotspots of barriers and overlooked accessibility issues in a continuous manner. These tools should be effective in identifying accessibility issues. Furthermore, they should motivate users, as this promotes employee productivity and increases interest in accessibility in general. In a comparative study, we applied four commercial monitoring systems on two of the Stuttgart Media University’s websites. The tools are: 1) The Accessibility module of Siteimprove from Siteimprove, 2) Pope Tech from Pope Tech, 3) WorldSpace Comply (now called axe Monitor) from Deque, and 4) ARC Monitoring from The Paciello Group. The criteria catalogue consists of functional criteria that we gleaned from literature and user experience criteria based on the User Experience Questionnaire. Based on a focus group consisting of experts of Stuttgart Media University, we derived individual weights for the criteria. The functional evaluation criteria are: Coverage of the website and the guidelines, completeness, correctness, support in locating errors, support for manual checks, degree of implementing gamification patterns, support for various input and report formats, and methodological support for the Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology 1.0 and for the German procurement law for public authorities Barrierefreie Informationstechnik-Verordnung 2.0. For determination of the user experience criteria, we conducted exploratory think-aloud user tests (n = 15) using a coaching approach. Every participant tested all tools for 15 min (within-subject design). The participants completed post-test questionnaires, including the User Experience Questionnaire. According to our results, Siteimprove turned out to be the best tool for our purposes. © Copyright © 2021 Burkard, Zimmermann and Schwarzer.",Article,Final,Scopus

Individuals with disabilities rely on online healthcare-related resources to access educational information and promote informed decision-making in their care. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) were created to provide universal web practices which complement the needs of all individuals, such as those with low vision or screen readers users. However, many websites and the resources within them (e.g., PDFs) do not prioritise WCAG, leaving individuals with disabilities at a disadvantage in terms of their autonomy and health literacy. The objective of this study is to investigate and describe the common web accessibility errors present on international occupational therapy and pediatric websites and the resources within them. This mixed methods study evaluates compliance to WCAG success criteria using automatic web accessibility evaluation tools, specifically WAVE and AChecker, and manual checks to capture the human element. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the frequency of errors across several success criteria within the sample websites and PDFs. A subsequent thematic analysis was used to further examine how and why these errors violate the WCAG success criteria. Through automatic evaluation tools, many websites and resources did not comply with numerous WCAG 2.0 success criteria. Through manual checks of the web pages and resources within them, 5 themes were identified: inaccessible images, challenges accessing additional resources, poor structural formatting, lack of tagging in PDFs, and minimal colour contrast. The results of this study can inform web developers and contributors (e.g., Occupational Therapists) on how to successfully produce accessible websites and PDFs to provide equal access to health information. In conclusion, this study adds to the current understanding that many public-facing websites and the resources within them (e.g., PDFs) are not accessible, including healthcare-related websites meant to support informed decision-making among individuals with disabilities. © 2023, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.

Web pages were ranked and grouped into three groups by number of errors, creating comparisons between states on accessibility barriers for people with disabilities. Results: All 56 U.S states and territories had COVID-19 information web pages and 29 states had centralized state vaccine registration web pages. Total errors, error density, and alert data were utilized to generate accessibility scores for each web page, the median score was 259 (range = 14 to 536 and IQR = 237) for information pages, and 146 (range = 10 to 281 and IQR = 105) for registration pages. Conclusions: These results highlight barriers people with disabilities may encounter when accessing information and registering for the COVID-19 vaccine, which underscore inequities in the pandemic response for the disability community and elevate the need to prioritize accessibility of public health information. © 2022 The Author(s)",Article,Final,Scopus

Accessibility of public sector websites has become legally binding through Directive (EU) 2016/2102 for EU member states. Automatic accessibility evaluation methods can only provide a superficial impression of the accessibility status. Only manual evaluation methods can facilitate a comprehensive accessibility check. So far, there is no systematic comparison of existing manual evaluation methods available that is based on real data. In this paper, we define a generic catalog of 22 criteria for assessing the quality of accessibility evaluation methods and specify individual weights for the criteria. We then compare two representatives of manual evaluation methods: BIK BITV-Test, as a representative of conformance-based methods; and BITV-Audit, as a representative of empiric-based methods. We analyze similarities and differences between these two methods, and identify weaknesses and strengths. Our results show an advantage of BITV-Audit over BIK BITV-Test, but other weightings could yield different results. Copyright © 2021 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

However, websites or catalogs do not provide reliable information, easy search, and intuitive access to these apps, causing access information difficulties. Therefore, this work proposes to develop a digital catalog of software focused on motor disability. This work performed a systematic search of websites and catalogs related to motor disability, a systematic search of the apps that the digital catalog would show, and a quality evaluation of selected apps using the Mobile Application Rating Scale tool. The digital catalog was developed with the information obtained in the previous phases combining the Prototyping and User Experience criteria, then assessed by final users, software testers, and a web accessibility evaluation tool. The catalog obtained a satisfactory quality score based on the end-users’ and therapists’ satisfaction when finding technological resources to use in their professional and health-care activities.

The surveys were conducted on 100 public administration sites, which are divided into 5 groups. The results of the study are presented. Conclusions were made for the accessibility of information in the public sphere of the Republic of Bulgaria. In recent months accessibility of these sites has been re-evaluated. The results show that not enough is being done to achieve accessibility while maintaining public administration websites in Bulgaria. Despite the overall increase in web accessibility of the sites being tested, there is still much work to be done on this. A statistical analysis of the different groups of public sites was conducted, and the group in which the accessibility was the best was examined.?he conclusion is that the accessibility of the websites of the public administration in the Republic of Bulgaria is not at the necessary level of accessibility, which does not allow the users with visual disability to access these sites easily. It is, therefore, necessary for the public administration and web application developers to implement the accessibility guidelines proposed in the standards and improve the accessibility of these websites.

When we talk about web accessibility, we refer to a web design and development that allows these people to perceive, understand, navigate and interact with the Web. Web accessibility also benefits other people, including elderly people whose abilities have declined as a result of age. The Web is an essential resource in human activity: education, employment, government, commerce, health, entertainment and many others benefit of the power of the Web. The aim of this systematic literature review is to analyze the empirical methods of evaluating accessibility to educational websites, disabilities and their errors described in a total of 25 selected studies. The results show that in 20 of the 25 papers, web accessibility was evaluated with automatic tools, in 2 papers it was evaluated with real users and in the other 3 papers with automatic tools, real users and experts. There is also evidence that all the educational websites analyzed in the papers need to correct errors. In conclusion, educational websites do not meet any version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and their conformance levels. According to the results, the empirical evaluation methods used for web accessibility could be improved by adopting automatic evaluation tools for website construction and manual mechanisms with web accessibility experts. The challenge for educational institutions is to carry out web accessibility projects to comply with WCAG and other web accessibility standards and current laws of educational inclusion. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,Final,Scopus

The WAD obligates that public sector bodies’ websites meet accessibility standards and provide an accessibility statement on the website informing about inaccessible content, and a feedback mechanism for reporting accessibility issues or requesting inaccessible content in an accessible format. The objective of this study was to evaluate how healthcare providers in Sweden have applied accessibility statements on their websites as regulated by law. A descriptive study using a mixed methods approach was conducted, by quantitative descriptive data analysis of the healthcare providers’ accessibility statements compliance to requirements and qualitative data analysis of the written information provided in the accessibility statement. All but one of the 37 evaluated healthcare providers published an accessibility statement. None of the healthcare providers fully met the requirements for accessibility statements, and no one complied with the intention of the law, i.e. to provide accessible health information and eHealth services. There was no or minor progress between the first and the latest published accessibility statement. The possibility to declare no or partial compliance with the law, or claim disproportionate burden, and the lack of enforcement procedures, risk producing symbolic actions e.g., publishing accessibility statements without intention to abide by the law. We suggest that the directives for accessibility statements should be advanced regarding comprehensiveness, understandability, and usefulness.

Thus, an evaluation model is also proposed to assess the accessibility of the applications from two perspectives, which are the inherent properties of the applications and the user experience of different disability categories. 46 official mobile applications were tested which related to 23 universities and institutes of Portugal, using automatic and manual testing methods. Several frequently occurring accessibility issues in the apps were identified and summarized, such as color contrast, touch target, missing focus. The results of the accessibility testing showed that the status of web accessibility of mobile applications in the higher education sector in Portugal is unsatisfactory. Most apps have multiple accessibility issues, and they are extremely unfriendly to the users with visual impairments. In addition, the study also proposed a series of accessibility recommendations for mobile application designers and developers, with the purpose of improving the accessibility of apps and providing an equitable user experience for all users. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Conference paper,Final,Scopus

It is important for web developers to ensure that their website is accessible according to WCAG standards for people with different range of abilities. There is plethora of tools for ensuring conformance to WCAG standards but not many studies compared performance of automatic WCAG tools. OBJECTIVE: This paper compares a set of ten WCAG tools and their results in terms of ease of comprehension and interpretation by web developers. We proposed a Common User Profile format to help personalize contents of website making it accessible to people with different range of abilities. METHODS: We selected ten WCAG tools from World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to evaluate landing pages of two popular websites. For each webpage, we identified accessibility issues and recommended alternate suggestions to help developers improve accessibility. Further, we highlighted accessibility issues that cannot be captured only through conformance to WCAG tools; and proposed additional methods to evaluate accessibility through an Inclusive User Model. We then demonstrated how simulation of user interaction can capture usability and accessibility issues that are not detected through only syntactic analysis of websites' content. Finally, we proposed a Common User Profile format that can be used to compare and contrast accessibility systems and services, and to simulate and personalize interaction for users with different range of abilities. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: After careful evaluation of two websites using the ten tools, we noted that, both websites lacked color contrast between background and foreground; lack of sign language alternatives; opening of pop-ups without proper warnings and so on. Further, results from comparative analysis of selected web accessibility tools noted that, there is no single tool that can be found ideal in all aspects. However, from our study, Utilitia Validator by Utilitia SP. z O.O was considered the most feasible tool. By rectifying and incorporating issues and alternate suggestions by simulation study and Common User Profile format respectively, developers can improve both websites making it accessible to maximum audience. © 2021 - IOS Press.

Accessibility is a crucial element that can make a difference and determine the success or failure of a digital business. The study was applied to 50 e-commerce sites in the top rankings according to the classification proposed by ecommerceDB. In evaluating the web accessibility of e-commerce sites, we applied an automatic review method based on a modification of Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM) 1.0. To evaluate accessibility, we used Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (WAVE) with the extension for Google Chrome, which helps verify password-protected, locally stored, or highly dynamic pages. The study found that the correlation between the ranking of e-commerce websites and accessibility barriers is 0.329, indicating that the correlation is low positive according to Spearman’s Rho. According to the WAVE analysis, the research results reveal that the top 10 most accessible websites are Sainsbury’s Supermarkets, Walmart, Target Corporation, Macy’s, IKEA, H&M Hennes, Chewy, Kroger, QVC, and Nike. The most significant number of accessibility barriers relate to contrast errors that must be corrected for e-commerce websites to reach an acceptable level of accessibility. The most neglected accessibility principle is perceivable, representing 83.1%, followed by operable with 13.7%, in third place is robust with 1.7% and finally understandable with 1.5%.

In this way, the main goal of this research was to investigate how people with dyslexia respond to a customised version of a website in terms of its effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction and suitability when compared to the default version of the website. The customisation of the investigated website was enabled with the aid of integrated assistive technology that offers people with dyslexia the opportunity to adjust a website themselves in accordance with their individual needs, demands and preferences. They can do this by changing the parameters, such as font size, font type and contrast between the background and text. The answers to the research questions were obtained with complementary research methods and techniques, including formal usability testing, thinking aloud protocol, log analyses, questionnaires and interviews. The empirical results show that participants experienced more issues when interacting with the default website, and they enjoyed more benefits when using the customised website. Too much information on the screen, not enough graphic elements, issues with visual appearance and inappropriately presented information were identified as the most common issues when interacting with the default website. When using the customised website, all participants agreed on a better user experience and, as the majority of them reported, this was due to appropriate contrast and font size. Additionally, the majority of participants also expressed desire to use the individual website adjustments regularly in the future. The conclusions of this investigation are that the individual website adjustments used in this research can not only help to minimise issues, but also eliminate challenges that people with dyslexia have when interacting with a website. Therefore, the primary contributions of this research are the empirical insights of interaction with both the default and customised version of the website for people with dyslexia. Furthermore, this research also has three secondary contributions: (1) detailed presentation and application the general usability evaluation procedure to a specific target group (people with dyslexia); (2) recommendations to adapt the usability evaluation methods for people with dyslexia; and (3) the usage of quantitative measurement instruments for the evaluation of a website’s usability and suitability for people with dyslexia. © 2019 by the authors.

The study has been typically done in between 2017 and 2018. With the help of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0), 13 standard websites were evaluated in 2017 and 35 in 2018. The study utilized the evaluation method to achieve the result from automated evaluation tool AChecker. The evaluation outcomes described that not a single websites handled the priority 2 (Level AA) checkpoints. This result suggests that not a single websites come across the level of Web accessibility for a kind people in India. The regular Web accessibility level deteriorated during 2017 and 2018 with the gradual expansion of Web pages complication and considerable quantity of content material. Nonetheless, private and public website pages had made some substantial change in the proper way, which demonstrated the private and public websites had recognized the level of Web accessibility issues are tried to handle them. WCAG 2.0 has been equally distributed to evaluate the accessibility restrictions that are present in both the studies and these limitations will work as a technical recommendation for the Web content providers. However, the private and public website pages had enhanced fundamentally with respect to availability because of the freedom of accessibility guidelines. Therefore, the objective clarifies that low level of Web accessibility in India is satisfactory to the lack of realization of guidelines instead of technical competencies. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Conference paper,Final,Scopus

Users who suffer from age-related changes, such as low vision, poor hearing, and diminishing motor skills, among others, have problems accessing the services offered by the web. Currently, there are qualitative and quantitative methods to check if a website is accessible. Most methods apply automatic tools because they are low cost, but they do not present an ideal solution. Instead, heuristic methods require manual support that will help the expert to assess accessibility by establishing severity ranges. This research used a modification of the Barrier Walkthrough method proposed by Giorgio Brajnik considering the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1. The modification consisted of including persistence to determine the severity of an accessibility barrier. This method enabled the measurement of the accessibility of websites to test a new heuristic process and to obtain sample data for analysis. The method was applied to 40 websites, including those of 30 universities in Latin America, according to the Webometrics ranking, and 10 websites among the most visited, according to Alexa ranking. With this heuristic method, the evaluators concluded that although a website is in a high-ranking position, this does not imply that it is accessible and inclusive. However, the manual method takes too long, and it is therefore too costly to solve accessibility problems. This research can serve as a starting point for future studies related to web accessibility heuristics. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,Final,Scopus

At present, it is common to have to fill out forms electronically in order to carry out administrative procedures. The web interfaces of public transactional e-Services must be accessible by system users, regardless of whether they are disabled or not, according to the regulatory framework. This accessibility is not always taken into consideration in online forms in a process flow. One possible reason for this is the fact that guides are not available to assist in the design and evaluation of their accessibility. It is necessary for the transactional processes on Government e-Service websites to be accessible and well designed, in accordance with the current standards. In order to achieve this goal, the standard Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) must be complied with, according to legislation. However, these guidelines do not cover many of the obstacles faced by people with disabilities, as well as the general public, while filling out web forms, thus leaving accessibility problems undetected and unsolved. For this reason, web accessibility standards are not enough and should be supplemented by official government design patterns focused on transactional e-Services and online forms. In this article, we propose a support resource, which includes the accessibility criteria to be followed while designing and evaluating government transactional e-Service websites that incorporate online forms in the process flow. For the purpose of evaluating the reliability of the method and explaining it, a study was carried out on a sample of Spanish government e-Services used for making appointments in order to detect accessibility and design problems; this is presented as an example of good practices. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Final,Scopus

Design/methodology/approach - A content analysis was conducted on 24 academic library websites discovered through Jeanne Burke's Higher Education Directory and the Alabama Colleges directory website. All data were collected within a month. Findings - Study data revealed that while academic libraries are offering more online services, many continue to lack certain services or fail to implement basic web design and accessibility standards. Research limitations/implications - Inclusion into the study was limited to the independent library websites of Alabama institutions offering four-year degree courses and content data discoverable within three clicks of the home page. Future studies might identify why certain libraries lack reference chat services, social media accounts and/or certain accessibility accommodations. Additional research might evaluate multilingual websites and their methods for providing language options. Practical implications - The results of this study should assist in the evaluation of library websites and increase awareness of design and accessibility standards, enabling designers and policy makers to improve upon future website designs. Originality/value - This study presents a depth of evaluation and currency unseen in most web content analyses.

A novel interval sampling algorithm based on the node's topological characteristics was proposed starting with the topological structure between web nodes in order to solve the problem. Each page was treated as a node and the similarity topological graph between web pages was constructed by the KNN-Graph algorithm. Then the importance of each node was obtained by its local and global topological characteristics and was sorted to get an orderly sequence of all the pages. The pages with interval sampling algorithm were chosen based on the sorting results. The method can achieve distributed sampling in different topological regions.

Two studies were performed, in which the accessibility of the selected platforms was studied in 2011 and 2016. Design/methodology/approach: The research was performed on publishing platforms than hosted more than 20 journals about human behaviour and factors that may influence it. The evaluation was carried out following the methodology described by the Web Accessibility Initiative in their Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology. Findings: The results show that, in spite of an improvement in accessibility, all the analysed electronic consultation platforms contain errors that could hinder their users’ access to their content. The incidence of errors found varies considerably among platforms. As the user interface of each platform analysed is common to all the online scientific electronic journals it hosts, the results obtained are valid for all other journals hosted on a given platform. Research limitations/implications: Obtained results were valid in the date and time the websites were analysed. Changes made on the websites since then make that the results of an accessibility analysis would be different. Practical implications: Analysed platforms would require taking steps to ensure their accessibility. Social implications: Users with disabilities cannot use these platforms appropriately due to the accessibility problems found. The lack of web accessibility also has implications regarding visibility of published articles and common users.

As some of the checkpoints require human inspection for conformance evaluation, evaluating a website will usually incur an expensive cost. To address this issue, crowdsourcing-based system is used in web accessibility evaluation to elicit contributions from volunteer participants. However, some of accessibility evaluation tasks are complicated and require a certain level of expertise in evaluation. This makes the task assignment in crowdsourcing a challenging problem in that poor evaluation accuracy will be resulted when complicated tasks are assigned to inexperienced participants. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a novel task assignment strategy called Evaluator-Decision-Based Assignment (EDBA) to better leverage the participation and expertise of the volunteers. Using evaluators' historical evaluation records and experts' review, we train a minimum cost model via machine learning methods to obtain an optimal task assignment map. Experiments on Chinese Web Accessibility Evaluation System show that our method achieves high accuracy in website accessibility evaluation. Meanwhile, the balanced assignments from EDBA also enable both novices and old hands effective participation in accessibility evaluation. © 2017 ACM.",Conference paper,Final,Scopus

In this kind of approaches, a small subset of pages in a website are chosen for evaluating the accessibility value of the whole website. Good sampling quality means the selected subset can represent well the accessibility level of the whole website, i.e. minimizing the accessibility evaluation difference between the whole site and the sampled subset. As existing studies show the accuracy of sampling methods depends heavily on the metric, we propose in this paper a specific sampling method OPS-WAQM that is optimized for Web Accessibility Quantitative Metric (WAQM). OPS-WAQM minimizes the sampling error by choosing the optimal sample numbers in different page depth layers. A greedy algorithm is proposed to approximately solve the optimization problem in an efficient way. We use a dataset of 20 websites, 365780 web pages to validate our method.

Evaluation of Web accessibility is carried out to conform to WCAG 2.0. Authors and evaluators consult specific techniques of WCAG 2.0 to achieve Web accessibility. Web accessibility, however, is not techniques issues but a communication problem. W3C/WAI has just started a task force to perform preliminary development of a new version of accessibility guidelines. So, now is a good time to reconsider Web accessibility guidelines which focus on communication problems of users. To have a rationale of requirements for upcoming version of Web accessibility guidelines, the proposed paper tries to draw a holistic view of Web accessibility in terms of communication model, which is derived from semiotics. This model uses triangle relationship, authors (developers), content, and users, of WAI model. Authors have a message they want to present to users. The message is encoded with Web technologies into content. Multi-modal content is decoded by user agents and assistive technologies to send a message as view-ports to users. You must notice that the relation between authors and content is unidirectional. The relation between content and users, however, is bidirectional. Users, who have a goal, interact with content through user agents and assistive technologies in a specific context of use. Based on this model, the following 4 points are discussed: (1) It is possible that users interact with content but it is not possible that users interact with authors, which makes communication difficult. (2) We must pay more attention to users’ goal and context when evaluating Web accessibility. (3) Evaluation guideline which does not focus on WCAG but approach Web accessibility from user side is needed. User-centered evaluation is important. (4) To compensate a lack of communication between authors and users, an intelligent content is needed. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Conference paper,Final,Scopus

Design: Web site evaluation. Setting: Urban public libraries in the United States of America. Subjects: The 127 library systems, which were both members of the Urban Libraries Council at the time of the study and located in the United States of America. Methods: Using the ""everyday life information seeking"" conceptual framework, an assessment of each of the web sites of the purposive sample of public library systems was performed by an online evaluation tool as well as visually and physically to determine web accessibility and, by extension, technology inclusiveness. Main Results: The results of the online accessibility evaluation tool revealed that not one of the sites surveyed was free of errors or alerts. Contrast errors (related to color combinations), missing alternative text (providing text alternatives for visual elements), and missing form labels (thereby preventing screen readers from performing searches and navigating to results) were the most common problems. Results of visual and physical scans revealed that many sites lacked specific links and/or resources for persons with disabilities, as well as noting that the resources available used oblique language and required many clicks to access. In addition, the vast majority neglected to feature links to national resources such as the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped. Conclusions: The web sites of urban public libraries are not yet completely accessible for persons with disabilities. At the very least they need coding fixes and ongoing maintenance to address the kinds of issues found by the online web evaluation tool used. In addition, resources for disabled persons should be prominently and clearly linked and promoted. Further research is called for, both in non-urban library systems and in testing a wider range of access technologies. Improvement efforts should acknowledge that web design that improves access for persons with disabilities serves the broader community as well. © 2015.",Article,Final,Scopus

The accessibility assessment was carried out to verify compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0) published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The main goal of this study is to determine whether people with disabilities are able to access and use government websites. In addition, we considered the Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM) to determine how easily a website can be accessed according to WCAG 2.0. The WCAG-EM provides guidance on how to use the methodology and considerations for specific situations. From the results, we conclude that the majority of the websites do not achieve an acceptable level of compliance. The websites of governmental institutions with the highest level of competitiveness do not show a greater level of web accessibility. Several non-compliance errors were found on the websites; by performing this evaluation, we have identified that there are major barriers for a large number of users. Therefore, there is significant work pending to make the websites examples of best practice in e-government sites. © 2017 IEEE.",Conference paper,Final,Scopus

This makes evaluating large websites all-but technically unfeasible. Therefore, sampling of the pages becomes a critical first step in the evaluation process. Current methods rely on drawing random samples, best guess samples, or convenience samples. In all cases the evaluation results cannot be trusted because the underlying structure and nature of the site are not known; they are missing 'website demographics'. By understanding the quantifiable statistics of a given population of pages we are better able to decide on the coverage we need for a full review, as well as the sample we need to draw in order to enact an evaluation. Our solution is to crawl a website comparing, and then clustering, the pages discovered based on Document Object Model block level similarity. This technique can be useful in reducing very large sites to a more manageable size, and allowing an 80% coverage by evaluating between ? 0.1-4% of pages; additionally, by refining our clustering algorithm, we discuss how this could be reduced further.

Eight blind and eight sighted participants undertook both protocols in a website evaluation. RVP was more effective as measured by problems encountered for both groups, although it was no more efficient than CVP. The severity of problems identified by both protocols was equivalent. As measured on the NASA TLX, participants found RVP found more demanding than CVP. Sighted participants found rating problems during CVP more disruptive than blind participants. These results show that RVP is a more useful protocol for practitioners and researchers even though it takes more time and is more demanding for participants. It is equally applicable for both blind and sighted participants. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2015.",Conference paper,Final,Scopus

Due to the massive number of pages in a website and possible involvement of human inspection for conformance checking, directly evaluating all the pages is prohibitively expensive. In practice, we usually select a representative sample for accessibility evaluation of the whole site. This makes the evaluation results heavily dependent on the pages selected. Undersampling may lead to a large bias in evaluation. But oversampling will incur high evaluation expense. To address this issue, this paper proposes a semi-supervised machine learning method, called active-prediction, to obtain the accessibility evaluation results for all pages in a site. Active-prediction casts the website accessibility evaluation into a prediction problem by building learning models for each checkpoint in evaluation and consequently avoids the expensive cost in human inspection. To achieve a higher prediction accuracy with only a small number of training data, active-prediction exploits active learning techniques to select the most informative pages to train the models. Experimental results show that the active-prediction could achieve a high accuracy on predicting the accessibility results and better reflect the accessibility level of the websites than the existing methods. ?Theory of computation, Theory and algorithms for application domains, Machine learning theory, Active learning ?Human-centered computing, Accessibility, Accessibility design and evaluation methods. © 2017 ACM.",Conference paper,Final,Scopus

In particular, the accessibility of Rich Internet Applications (RIA) poses serious challenges for visually impaired users employing screen readers. In this study, we performed an accessibility evaluation of a sample of 25 interface components from the Bootstrap front-end framework. The evaluation involved conformance analyses of the components with the Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) 1.0 and expert manual evaluations of interfaces using Android's TalkBack and Apple iOS's VoiceOver screen readers. The results showed that the sampled interface components were in conformance with ARIA's techniques. However, in the empirical tests, 10 of 25 components in TalkBack and 4 of 25 components in VoiceOver, showed accessibility problems that can cause serious issues to visually impaired users on mobile devices. This shows that developers need to be aware of mobile devices' screen readers limitations even when implementing compliant interface components, and that more work needs to be done to provide more satisfactory interaction for RIA to be used by visually impaired users on mobile devices. © 2016 ACM.",Conference paper,Final,Scopus

Two evaluation studies were carried out in 2009 and 2013, respectively. Thirty-eight popular Chinese websites were evaluated in 2009 and fifty in 2013 with reference to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (WCAG). The studies applied the conformance evaluation method with the help of the automatic evaluation tool Hera. The evaluation results indicated that none of the surveyed websites passed all the checkpoints of Priority 1 in both studies, which means no website met the minimum requirement for web accessibility. The average level of web accessibility worsened between 2009 and 2013 due to the increase of website complexity and the amount of content. However, e-government websites had made some significant improvement during these 4 years, which indicated that the government had realized the web accessibility issues and made some effort to address them. The evaluation also revealed five major accessibility barriers existing in both studies, and these barriers also served as technical suggestions for web content providers. The web accessibility of Chinese websites is far from satisfactory, and it is getting worse from 2009 to 2013. However, e-government websites had improved significantly in regards to accessibility due to the release of accessibility regulations. Thus, the reason that explains low web accessibility in China is the lack of awareness rather than lack of technical skills. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,Final,Scopus

The Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII) provides user interface adaptation based on peoples individual needs and preferences. These preferences are stored in so-called preference sets and can also contain sematic settings.

They were asked to first carry out an individual assessment of a web page. Later on, they were matched randomly to constitute a group of two and they were asked to revise their initial assessment and to produce a group assessment of the same page. Results indicate that significant differences were found for sensitivity (inversely related to false negatives: +8%) and agreement (when measured in terms of the majority view: +10%). Members of groups exhibited strong agreement on the evaluation results among them and with the group outcome. Other measures of validity and reliability are not significantly affected by group work. Practical implications of these findings are that, for example, when it is important to reduce the false-negative rate, then employing a group of two people is more useful than having individuals carrying out the assessment. Openings for future research include further explorations of whether similar results hold for groups larger than two or what is the effect of mixing people with different accessibility background. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS When novice accessibility evaluators work in groups, their ability to identify all the true problems increases (by 8%). Likewise, reliability of group evaluations increases (by 10%).

This may lead to a biased evaluation when the distribution of checkpoint violations in a website is skewed and the selected samples do not provide a good representation of the entire website. To improve sampling quality, stratified sampling methods first cluster web pages in a site and then draw samples from each cluster. In existing stratified sampling methods, however, all the pages in a website need to be analyzed for clustering, causing huge I/O and computation costs. To address this issue, we propose a novel page sampling method based on URL clustering for web accessibility evaluation, namely URLSamp. Using only the URL information for stratified page sampling, URLSamp can efficiently scale to large websites. Meanwhile, by exploiting similarities in URL patterns, URLSamp cluster pages by their generating scripts and can thus effectively detect accessibility problems from web page templates. We use a data set of 45 web sites to validate our method. Experimental results show that our URLSamp method is both effective and efficient for web accessibility evaluation. © 2015, Journal of Zhejiang University Science Editorial Office and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,Final,Scopus

Result: The main reported known problems belonged to ""scripts must have functional text,"" ""text equivalents,"" ""accessible forms,"" and ""text links for server-side image map"". Although the mean accessibility errors in governmental (10.25 ± 7.274) and organizational (12.31 ± 9.469) websites were less than those in the other domains, the differences were not significant (P = 0.60). Findings showed no significant correlation (P > 0.05) between the extent of known problems (16.50 ± 12.18) and Alexa ranking (253675.07 ± 534690.947). Furthermore, most websites on kidney transplant were not certified by the HONcode. Conclusion: The health websites designers should be aware of accessibility problems, because there is a growing population of potential users with disabilities. This study indicated the need to ensure the compliance of kidney transplant websites with accessibility guidelines such as Section 508. Furthermore, most surveyed websites were of poor quality and unreliable. Therefore, physicians should warn their patients about unqualified online health information and guide them to websites which are more reliable. © 2018, Urology and Nephrology Research Centre.",Article,Final,Scopus
