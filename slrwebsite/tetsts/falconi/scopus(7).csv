For this reason, it has been object of extensive research. Analytical correlations that allow it to be calculated have been developed and are used in engine simulations. They are usually preferred to detailed chemical kinetic models for saving computational time. Therefore, an accurate as possible formulation for such expressions is needed for successful simulations. However, many previous empirical correlations have been based on a limited set of experimental measurements, which have been often carried out over a limited range of operating conditions. Thus, it can result in low accuracy and usability. In this study, measurements of laminar flame speeds obtained by several workers are collected, compared and critically analyzed with the aim to develop more accurate empirical correlations for laminar flame speeds as a function of equivalence ratio and unburned mixture temperature and pressure over a wide range of operating conditions, namely ?=0.6-1.7, pu=1-50 atm and Tu=298-800K. The purpose is to provide simple and workable expressions for modeling the laminar flame speed of practical fuels used in spark-ignition engines. Pure compounds, such as methane and propane and binary mixtures of methane/ethane and methane/propane, as well as more complex fuels including natural gas and gasoline, are considered. A comparison with available empirical correlations in the literature is also provided. © IMechE 2017.",Article,Final,Scopus

Eye-tracking is utilised at the interface between the human and the technology side of digitalisation and it is exactly at that interface, where technological innovations translate into economic values through productivity gains, increased sales, higher realised prices, improved customer satisfaction, fewer litigation cases, longer lasting customer relationships and thereby increased lifetime customer value, more profitable management decisions and improved shareholder trust. Unfortunately, numerous frictions between ""machines"" and humans exist at these interfaces. Over the last decades, scientists have refined methods and invented tools to detect those frictions, reflected in visual perception: eye-tracking. While the causes of these frictions are countless, eye-tracking is a single scientific method for detecting very many of them. Eye-tracking - so to speak - is ""digitalisation's best friend"". Because of the numerous applications eye-tracking provides for reducing these frictions at the human-machine interface, users pursuing a digitalisation strategy should become aware of the financial benefits by using this scientific method in their applied research and development.

Some of these schemes outperform others by various metrics in various contexts. However, none unilaterally outperform all others, and so text passwords persist as the main scheme applications depend upon. In this paper, we challenge the long-standing assumption that only one authentication scheme can be offered by an application service. We propose Choose Your Own Authentication (CYOA): a novel authentication architecture that enables users to choose a scheme amongst several available alternatives. CYOA would enable users to select whichever scheme best suits their preferences, abilities, and usage context. Existing text password systems could easily be replaced. Furthermore, the three-party architecture would enable delegating the management of authentication systems to trusted-third parties. The architecture allows rapid deployment and testing of novel authentication technologies. Our two-week usability study suggests that participants were willing to leverage alternative schemes. Participants were confident that CYOA could keep their financial information secure. © 2015 ACM.",Conference paper,Final,Scopus

As security and usability are two growing concerns for e-banking users, banks have invested heavily in improving their web portals security and user experience and trust in them. Despite considerable efforts to evaluate particular security and usability features in e-banking systems, a dedicated security and usability evaluation model that can be used as a guide in the development of e-banking assets remains much less explored. To build a comprehensive security and usability evaluation framework, we first extract security and usability evaluation metrics from the conducted literature review and then include several other evaluation metrics that were not previously identified in the literature. We then propose a structured inspection model for thoroughly evaluating the usability and security of internal and external e-banking assets. We argue that the proposed e-banking security and usability evaluation frameworks in the literature in addition to the existing standards of security best practices (e.g., NIST and ISO) are by no means comprehensive and lack some essential and key evaluation metrics that are of particular interest to e-banking portals. In order to demonstrate the inadequacy of existing models, we use the proposed framework to evaluate five major banks. The evaluation reveals several shortcomings in identifying both missing or incorrectly implemented security and privacy features. Our goal is to encourage other researchers to build upon our work. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Wien.",Article,Final,Scopus

In industry as well as academia, the ISO 9241-11 norm provides the dominant view on usability, stating that usability is a function of effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. Although intuitively, usability requirements should be part of a software's design in an early stage, conceptually and empirically, it seems more likely that performance requirements (i.e., the absence of errors) should be the center of concern. This paper offers an elaborated view on usability, satisfaction, and performance. Certain theoretical conceptions are tested with data gathered from professional users of banking and hospital systems by means of a 4-year single-item survey and a structured questionnaire, respectively. Results suggested that performance factors (i.e., efficiency) are more important than usability in understanding why stakeholders are satisfied with a system or not. Moreover, it neither is dissatisfaction with a system nor that a system is less usable that predicate requirements change. Instead, avoiding machine inaccuracy best predicted the variability in agreement to ""must have"" requirements, while achieving human accuracy predicted the variability in agreement to the ""won't have"" requirements. The present contribution provides a consistent research framework that can bring more focus to design (i.e., prioritization), clarify discussions about design trade-offs, makes concepts measurable, and eventually may lead to better-informed designs. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

RIMS should have some effective usability features or success components of its strategic information access and display. The success or failure of the implementation of RIMS is highly dependent on the level of success and user acceptance. The measurement of IS success remains a top concern for researchers, practitioners and managers. Thus, the evaluation of RIMS success is vital. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to propose a success model of RIMS implementation based on an extensive literature review that shows inter-relationship among IS success factors. Results from the literature review shows that several IS success studies have used and extended DeLone & McLean model in different context such as E-Learning, Learning Management System (LMS), Banking, Project Management, Health Management etc. Prior studies have extended the generic framework of DeLone & McLean model. However, few have extended it to different dimensions such as technological, organization and human perspective. Hence, to fill this gap the proposed model is used to describe the multidimensional factors that influence the success and user acceptance of RIMS. Three important aspects of IS success such as human, organization and technology are studied. Outcomes of this study can be used as a guideline for research institutions' management, RIMS designers and researchers when implementing and using RIMS. © 2017 IEEE.",Conference paper,Final,Scopus

The number of KoinWorks mobile application users is increasing however there are still some obstacles along the way. Canceled order rates of KoinWorks are still quite high. In 2017, there are only 7,5% of the total users who actually did the transaction. In addition, the result of a preliminary study conducted on 114 respondents shows that nearly 75% of the users find it difficult to use the application. This study aims to evaluate the usability of KoinWorks mobile application, to analyze the existing usability problem, and to achieve a better usability interface design. Usability is measured using both quantitative and qualitative measurements. The quantitative measurement comprises user performance metrics such as task success, time on task and error that measure effectiveness and efficiency of the mobile application as well as saccade on eye tracking. The qualitative measurements include the System Usability Scale questionnaire (SUS), Questionnaire for User Interface Satisfaction (QUIS) and Retrospective Think Aloud (RTA).

Design/methodology/approach: The collected data have been analyzed using univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis techniques. Specifically, descriptive statistics have been assessed to examine the basic characteristics of the sample data. Confirmatory factor analysis with maximum likelihood criteria has been adopted for the measurement and validation of various constructs. Independent samples t-test has been used to compare the CL of public and private firms, banks and insurance firms, and for some of the demographic variables like gender, marital status, etc. One-way ANOVA has been used to compare the CL for variables having more than two groups. Structural equation modeling (SEM) has been used to measure the impact of CL on the BP of financial services firms. Findings: The result shows that BP is a higher-order construct measured in terms of word-of-mouth, repurchase intention, price premium and share of wallet. Though each of the four measures of CL is special and unique in nature, yet a high level of positive correlation has been seen among these dimensions. The study reveals that CL is not significantly different for the banking firms and insurance firms in Punjab. Research limitations/implications: The authors consider this work as one of the foundational elements that will enable further advances toward the governance of multi-layer business impact modeling systems. Extensive usability tests would enable to further confirm the findings of the paper. This study contributes to the customer relationship management and services marketing literature by providing empirical support for CL and BP relationship in the Indian context. Practical implications: The approach described here should improve the maintainability, reuse and clarity of business process models and in extension improve data for CL in large banking and insurance organizations. The approaches described here should improve the maintainability, reuse and clarity of loyalty and relationship of the customer with that of organizations. This can improve data for customer relationship and loyalty in banking and insurance sector. Originality/value: This paper fulfills an identified gap to enabling SEM enabled models for data regarding customer relationship and loyalty. Loyalty revolves around the concept of relationship. CL is not a new concept, but recent years have demonstrated a developing interest to fabricate CL because of customer-oriented techniques or strategies. Over the previous era, CL has been broadly inspected inside marketing, trades and transactions. It can be concluded that the CL significantly influences BP. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,Final,Scopus

Due to technical, social, and financial constraints, an organization can only implement a few of many change alternatives. Hence, a wise selection of a change alternative is fundamentally influential for the growth of the organization. Organizations lack knowledge bases to effectively capture rationale for a design change; i.e., identifying the potential effects a design change. In this paper, (1) we propose a knowledge base called multiple-domain matrix that comprises the relationships among different parameters that are building blocks of a product and its manufacturing system. (2) Using the indirect change propagation method, we capture these relationships to identify the potential effects of a design change. (3) We propose a cost-based metric called change propagation impact (CPI) to quantify the effects that are captured from the multiple-domain matrix.

Therefore, this paper aims to design a measurement tool to evaluate the usability of mobile applications based on the usability attributes and dimensions that must be considered in the interface. To obtain the appropriate attributes, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) has been conducted and the Goal Question Metric (GQM) has been used to design the tool. From 261 related works only 18 most relevant ones were selected, through four SLR. 25 dimensions were found through the SLR, but some of these dimensions are synonymous or a part of other dimensions.

As security and usability are two growing concerns for online banking users, banks have invested heavily in improving their web portals security and user experience and trust in them. Despite considerable efforts to evaluate particular security and usability features in online banking, a dedicated security and usability evaluation framework that can be used as a guide in online banking development remains much less explored. In this work, we first extract security and usability evaluation metrics from the conducted literature review. We then include several other evaluation metrics that were not previously identified in the literature. We argue that the proposed online banking security and usability evaluation frameworks in the literature in addition to the existing standards of security best practices (e.g., NIST and ISO) are by no means comprehensive and lack some essential and key evaluation metrics that are of particular interest to online banking portals. In order to demonstrate the inadequacy of existing frameworks, we use some frameworks to evaluate five major banks. The evaluation reveals several shortcomings in identifying both missing or incorrectly implemented security and privacy features.

The present work is one of the steps of a broader study to identify standardized protocols to evaluate the health information systems as medicines and medical devices are evaluated by clinical trials. The goal of the present work was to evaluate the effect of the introduction of an information system for monitoring tuberculosis treatment (SISTB) in a Brazilian municipality from the patients’ perspective. The Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire and the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems were answered by the patients before and after the SISTB introduction, for comparison. Patients from an outpatient clinic, formed the control group, that is, at this site was not implanted the SISTB. Descriptive statistics and mixed effects model were used for data analysis. Eighty-eight interviews were conducted in the study. The questionnaire’s results presented better averages after the system introduction but were not considered statistically significant. Therefore, it was not possible to associate system implantation with improved patient satisfaction. The HIS evaluation need be complete, the technical and managerial evaluation, the safety, the impact on the professionals and direct and/or indirect impact on patients are important.

Mobile banking application is increasingly recognized as an emergent m-commerce application which dignified to become the giant killer mobile application arena. However, prominent usability evaluation models for mobile applications are too general and do not adequately capture the complexities of interacting with m-banking application platform. Similarly, there are no sufficient descriptions concerning the relationship between phases and appropriate usability measures for a specific application. Some banks do not offer m-banking application, while those that offer have inadequate functionalities and this shows that their interfaces are still insufficient and not user friendly. To date, usability and measurements for mbanking application in particular is very limited or even isolated and this makes usability evaluation of m-banking more of challenging. Consequently, this report proposes to address this matter by proposing a suitable and an appropriate set of usability dimensions and measurements for m-banking evaluation.

However, the users are likely to feel inconvenient, or even discard the service. This paper, therefore, addresses this issue and introduces a novel method, referred to as the Quantified riSk and Benefit adaptive Authentication Factors combination (QSBAF). QSBAF balances the requirements for both security and usability in the authentication of an information system and improves the system's ability to respond quickly to emerging risky events. In QSBAF, the authentication factors can be dynamically combined on the basis of quantified risk, benefit measurements, and combination policies. Furthermore, QSBAF provides an adaptive mechanism, which is driven by history data to justify the measurements of risk and benefit. In this paper, we use the online banking system as a typical scenario to demonstrate the usage of QSBAF.

The improved electrical conductivity in Ca0.25Sr0.75Fe0.75Mo0.25O3 ? ? under reducing conditions calls for testing this oxide as an anode material. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,Final,Scopus

Web services provide Web service users platform independence while using software. It enables businesses to collaborate by using Web services from Web service providers. Estimating a Cost of Service (CoS) is essential when pricing, selecting, and monitoring a Web service. The concept of cost is not restricted to financial value of technology hardware and software. The cost concept can also include time, usability, and maintenance. Cost of a Web service can be estimated by identifying the attributes of cost from the perspective of different stakeholders such as Web service provider, Web service consumer, Web service repository moderator, and Web service policy maker. In addition, analyzing different roles in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) will further provide more knowledge about different perspectives of cost concepts in SOA. This paper addresses the essential attributes of estimating cost of a Web service. Moreover, this paper specifies attributes of measuring CoS, defines these attributes, and defines metrics and units of these attributes. Additionally, it provides further hierarchy classification of Web service cost concepts. It also provides a model for evaluating Web service cost based on different cost criteria. By measuring CoS, Web service stakeholders will be able to estimate an accurate value to the CoS. © 2017 IEEE.",Conference paper,Final,Scopus

Hospital financial requirements are gathered from management and staffs as the conceptual basis to model the proposed application. Users' data are then used to develop a software prototype. Factors affecting behavioral intention to adopt the software are analyzed for further usability assessment. The principal criteria are perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and attitude toward using. Acceptance test is conducted based on Technology Acceptance Model. The results show that the management and staffs are welcomed to have the software, subject to faster time to learn (p-value 0.000), and easy financial management content to grasp (p-value 0.015), having the coefficient of determination 87.3% at 0.05 level of significance. Thus, software developed by the proposed approach will help hospital executives and personnel to raise omniscience in financial management that maintains the hospital sustainability. © 2016 IEEE.",Conference paper,Final,Scopus

The criteria for evaluating university websites are very vague and are usually unknown to most developers, which adversely impacts the user-experience of the students visiting such websites. To solve this problem, we devised a usability metric and examined the leading university websites to analyze whether these websites were able to meet the requirements of students. In this research, we applied qualitative and quantitative approaches by considering 300 students and evaluating 86 university websites (26 from Canada, 30 from the United States, and 30 from Europe) based on a six-attribute metric comprising navigation, organization, ease of use (simplicity), design (layout), communication and content. From the evaluation results, we find that the 88% of the students are satisfied with our proposed usability attributes, but that most universities fail to meet basic standards of usability as desired by the students. The findings also show that the usability evaluation score for each usability feature varies from country to country, such as for (1) multiple language support ? 23% of the Canadian websites, 63% of the European websites and none of the USA websites has the feature; for (2) Scholarships/Funding/Financial Aid link ? 24% of the Canadian websites, 80% of the European and the USA websites has the feature; for (3) admission link ? 88% of the Canadian websites, 20% of the European websites and 90% of the USA websites has the feature. In addition, from the evaluative result we find that our proposed approach will not only increase the usability of academic websites but will also provide an easiest way to covert prospective student inquiries into enrollment opportunities. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,Final,Scopus

A company's website plays an important role in this process, but little is known about how job-seekers' experiences on the website affects their attitudes and intentions toward the company. This research examines the extent to which job-seekers' expectations about the company are confirmed or disconfirmed by their experiences with the website and the degree that these expectations affect their intentions. The presented theoretical model is based on the expectation confirmation model adapted to include website usability and its determinants. Data to empirical test the model were collected by administering a survey to university students and WebTurk contract workers. The sample consisted of 199 usable responses. The empirical analysis used structural equations modeling. The fit of the measured theoretical model to the data was also good and all the paths in the measurement and structural models were statistically significant. The structural model shows that expectation-confirmation influences respondents' intentions, indirectly, through satisfaction with the website and perceived usefulness of the site. Furthermore, engagement, website content and interactivity influence website usability while website usability influences expectation confirmation and perceived usefulness. Implications and conclusions based on these findings were also provided. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Article,Final,Scopus
