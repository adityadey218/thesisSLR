Within this debate, chimpanzee behavior is often cited to explain humans' propensity for violence; the claim is that male chimpanzees kill outsiders because they are evolutionarily inclined, suggesting to some that people are too. The longstanding critique that killing is instead due to human disturbance has been pronounced dead and buried. In Chimpanzees, War, and History, R. Brian Ferguson challenges this consensus. By historically contextualizing every reported chimpanzee killing, Ferguson offers and empirically substantiates two hypotheses. Primarily, he provides detailed demonstration of the connection between human impact and intergroup killing of adult chimpanzees. Secondarily, he argues that killings within social groups reflect status conflicts, display violence against defenseless individuals, and payback killings of fallen status bullies. Ferguson also explains broad chimpanzee-bonobo differences in violence through constructed and transmitted social organizations consistent with new perspectives in evolutionary theory. He deconstructs efforts to illuminate human warfare via chimpanzee analogy, and provides an alternative anthropological theory grounded in Pan-human contrasts that is applicable to different types of warfare. Bringing readers on a journey through theoretical struggle and clashing ideas about chimpanzees, bonobos, and evolution, Ferguson opens new ground on the age-old question—are men born to kill? © Oxford University Press 2023.",Book,Final,Scopus

A literature review was conducted for COVID-19 mortality in PubMed, Scopus, and various preprint servers (bioRxiv, medRxiv and SSRN), with 97 observational studies and preprints, consisting of survivor and non-survivor sub-populations. This meta/network analysis comprised 19,014 COVID-19 patients, consisting of 14,359 survivors and 4655 non-survivors. Meta and network analyses were performed using META-MAR V2.7.0 and PAST software. The study revealed that non-survivors of COVID-19 had elevated levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase and creatinine, as well as a higher number of neutrophils. Non-survivors had fewer lymphocytes and platelets, as well as lower hemoglobin and albumin concentrations. Age, hypertension, and cerebrovascular disease were shown to be the most influential risk factors among non-survivors. The most common complication among non-survivors was heart failure, followed by septic shock and respiratory failure. Platelet counts, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, albumin, and blood urea nitrogen levels were all linked to ICU admission. Hemoglobin levels preferred non-ICU patients. Lower levels of hemoglobin, lymphocytes, and albumin were associated with increased mortality in ICU patients. This meta-analysis showed that inexpensive and fast biochemical and hematological tests, as well as pre-existing conditions and complications, can be used to estimate the risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients. © 2023, The Author(s).",Article,Final,Scopus

It is responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. The ability to gain quick control of the pandemic has been hampered by a lack of detailed knowledge about SARS-CoV-2-host interactions, mainly in relation to viral biology and host immune response. The rapid clinical course seen in COVID-19 indicates that infection control in asymptomatic patients or patients with mild disease is probably due to the innate immune response, as, considering that SARS-CoV-2 is new to humans, an effective adaptive response would not be expected to occur until approximately 2–3 weeks after contact with the virus. Antiviral innate immunity has humoral components (complement and coagulation-fibrinolysis systems, soluble proteins that recognize glycans on cell surface, interferons, chemokines, and naturally occurring antibodies) and cellular components (natural killer cells and other innate lymphocytes). Failure of this system would pave the way for uncontrolled viral replication in the airways and the mounting of an adaptive immune response, potentially amplified by an inflammatory cascade. Severe COVID-19 appears to be due not only to viral infection but also to a dysregulated immune and inflammatory response. In this paper, the authors review the most recent publications on the immunobiology of SARS-CoV-2, virus interactions with target cells, and host immune responses, and highlight possible associations between deficient innate and acquired immune responses and disease progression and mortality. Immunotherapeutic strategies targeting both the virus and dysfunctional immune responses are also addressed. © 2021 Sociedade Portuguesa de Pneumologia",Review,Final,Scopus

Developers use refactoring as a corrective measure for the treatment of bad smells. The current study aids the developers in the application of refactoring by identifying the critical classes, that is, classes that are challenging to maintain and are of degraded quality. In this study, 10 quality metrics and 10 bad smells have been selected to conduct an investigation on different releases of five open-source systems. A new metric, severity factor (SF) has been introduced that categorizes the classes of the selected systems into four criticality levels—severe, major, mid, and low. Also, the relationship between SF, criticality levels, and the refactoring operations has been analyzed. The findings show that 60% of the total classes have been affected by bad smells, and long statement is the most dominant smell present in 27.6% of the classes. The results show 84% of the refactoring operations have been performed on highly critical classes. Thus, the SF metric plays a crucial role in driving the developer's attention to the critical classes that need to be treated urgently. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Article,Article in press,Scopus

As a characteristic sign of COVID-19 patient, olfactory dysfunction (OD) poses considerable problems for patients. In China, acupuncture has been widely used to treat OD caused by COVID-19, but there is still a lack of evidence-based medical evaluation. This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for the treatment of COVID-19 OD. Methods: According to the retrieval strategies, randomized controlled trials on the acupuncture for COVID-19 OD were obtained from Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, the Chinese Scientific Journal Database and the Wanfang Database, regardless of publication date, or language. Studies were screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the Cochrane risk bias assessment tool was used to evaluate the quality of the studies. The meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager (RevMan 5.3) and STATA 14.2 software. Ultimately, the evidentiary grade for the results will be evaluated. Results: The results of this meta-analysis will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. Conclusion: This study will provide up-to-date summary proof for evaluating the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for COVID-19 OD. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

COVID-19 infection is commonly associated with symptoms like coughing, fever, and shortness of breath, besides, the reports of muscle pain, anosmia, hyposmia, and loss of taste are becoming evident. Recent reports suggest the pathogenic invasion of the SARS-CoV-2 into the CNS, that could thereby result in devastating long term complications, primarily because some of these complications may go unnoticed for a long time. Evidence suggest that the virus could enter the CNS through angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor, neuronal transport, haematogenous route, and nasal route via olfactory bulb, cribriform plate, and propagates through trans-synaptic signalling, and shows retrograde movement into the CNS along nerve fiber. COVID-19 induces CNS inflammation and neurological degenerative damage through a diverse mechanism which includes ACE-2 receptor damage, cytokine-associated injury or cytokine storm syndrome, secondary hypoxia, demyelination, blood-brain barrier disruption, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation. Viral invasion into the CNS has been reported to show association with complications like Parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disorder, meningitis, encephalopathy, anosmia, hyposmia, anxiety, depression, psychiatric symptoms, seizures, stroke, etc. This review provides a detailed discussion of the CNS pathogenesis of COVID-19. Authors conclude that the COVID-19 cannot just be considered as a disorder of the pulmonary or peripheral system, rather it has a significant CNS involvement. Therefore, CNS aspects of the COVID-19 should be monitored very closely to prevent long term CNS complications, even after the patient has recovered from COVID-19. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.",Article,Final,Scopus

The variety of malignant tumors that arise in the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx, and adjacent mesenchymal tissues translates into a proportionally vast spectrum of prognoses, with some histologies such as olfactory neuroblastoma being associated with rare disease-specific death to other histologies such as mucosal melanoma for which survival beyond 5 years is considered a fortunate exception. Parallel to prognosis, treatment of sinonasal cancers is complex, controversial, and deeply dependent upon the putative pretreatment diagnosis. Given their heterogeneity, cancers of the ventral skull base are particularly prone to multidisciplinary management, which is indispensable. The therapeutic options available to date for these cancers include surgery, which currently remains the mainstay of treatment in most cases, along with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Biotherapy and immunotherapy are only anecdotally and compassionately used. For each histology, a careful selection of modalities and their timing is paramount to ensure the best chance of cure. In keeping with the principles of precision medicine, several nuances displayed by malignancies of the ventral skull base are being considered as treatment-driving characteristics. This current trend arose from the observation that a remarkable variability of behavior can be observed even within a single histology. Although evidence is lacking in this field and several potential customizations of treatment are still at a theoretical level, understanding of these cancers is rapidly evolving and practical applications of this increasing knowledge is the much-needed step forward in the management of such rare cancers.

So are the potential risks of, e.g., vulnerabilities being introduced in projects not actively maintained. By assessing an OSS project's capability to stay viable and maintained over time without interruption or weakening, i.e., the OSS health, users can consider the risk implied by using the OSS as is, and if necessary, decide whether to help improve the health or choose another option. However, such assessment is complex as OSS health covers a wide range of sub-topics, and existing support is limited. Aim: We aim to create an overview of characteristics that affect the health of an OSS project and enable the assessment thereof. Method: We conduct a snowball literature review based on a start set of 9 papers, and identify 146 relevant papers over two iterations of forward and backward snowballing. Health characteristics are elicited and coded using structured and axial coding into a framework structure. Results: The final framework consists of 107 health characteristics divided among 15 themes. Characteristics address the socio-technical spectrum of the community of actors maintaining the OSS project, the software and other deliverables being maintained, and the orchestration facilitating the maintenance. Characteristics are further divided based on the level of abstraction they address, i.e., the OSS project-level specifically, or the project's overarching ecosystem of related OSS projects. Conclusion: The framework provides an overview of the wide span of health characteristics that may need to be considered when evaluating OSS health and can serve as a foundation both for research and practice.  © 2022 Owner/Author.",Conference paper,Final,Scopus

This uncommon capacity for regeneration offers an opportunity to understand mechanisms that promote the recovery of sensory function after taste and smell loss. Immune responses appear to influence degeneration and later regeneration of olfactory sensory neurons and taste receptor cells. Here we review surgical, chemical, and inflammatory injury models and evidence that immune responses promote or deter chemosensory cell regeneration. Macrophage and neutrophil responses to chemosensory receptor injury have been the most widely studied without consensus on their net effects on regeneration. We discuss possible technical and biological reasons for the discrepancy, such as the difference between peripheral and central structures, and suggest directions for progress in understanding immune regulation of chemosensory regeneration. Our mechanistic understanding of immune-chemosensory cell interactions must be expanded before therapies can be developed for recovering the sensation of taste and smell after head injury from traumatic nerve damage and infection. Chemosensory loss leads to decreased quality of life, depression, nutritional challenges, and exposure to environmental dangers highlighting the need for further studies in this area.  © 2022 The Author(s).

The rarity and heterogeneity of sinonasal cancers have hampered large non-population-based analyses. Methodology: All patients receiving TES-including treatment between 1995 and 2021 in 5 referral hospitals were included. A prognostic study was performed, and multivariable models were transformed into nomograms. Training and validation sets were based on results from 3 European and 2 non-European centres, respectively. Results: The training and validation set included 940 and 420 patients, respectively. The mean age at surgery, primary-versus-recurrent presentation, histology distribution, type of surgery, T category and type of adjuvant treatment were differently distributed in the training and validation set. In the training set, 5-year overall survival and recurrence-free survival with a 95%-confidence interval were 72.7% (69.5–76.0%) and 66.4% (63.1–69.8%), respectively, significantly varying with histology. At multivariable analyses, age, gender, previous treatment, the extent of resection on the cranial, lateral and posterolateral axes, grade/subtype, T category, nodal status, margin status and adjuvant treatment were all associated with different prognostic outcomes, displaying a heterogeneous significance and effect size according to histology. The internal and external validation of nomograms was satisfactory (optimism-corrected C-index >0.7 and cumulative area under curve >0.7) for all histologies but mucosal melanoma. Conclusions: Outcomes of TES-based treatment of sinonasal cancers vary substantially with histology. This large, non-population-based study provides benchmark data on the prognosis of sinonasal cancers that are deemed suitable for treatment including TES. © 2022 The Authors",Article,Final,Scopus

A good design allows complex systems to evolve with little effort and in an economically efficient way. When design deviations are detected, refactoring techniques are applied to eliminate or at least reduce the identified flaws. A number of studies show that not all refactoring techniques contribute to improving the quality of different software systems equally. Therefore, effective approaches to measuring the impact of refactoring on software quality are required. In this study, we examine approaches to estimate the effect of applied refactoring techniques on the maintainability of Java based software systems. Since refactoring primarily affects the system's internal structure, maintainability was put in the focus of the study. We conducted a brief literature review, limiting our study on quantitative metrics. The results show that researchers use different approaches for evaluating the impact of refactoring on the observed Java based software systems. In some studies, researchers measured the effect of refactoring on the internal structure attributes measured by software metrics, e.g. C&K metric suite but the scope of our research was limited to the effects of refactoring on maintainability. In other studies, the effects of refactoring are estimated through external quality attributes, e.g. maintainability, readability, and understandability. Additionally, some researchers observed the impact of refactoring indirectly, e.g. through the defect proneness of classes of observed systems. Copyright © 2019 for this paper by its authors.

A systematic literature review,2022,Information and Software Technology,144,,106783,,,,16,10.1016/j.infsof.2021.106783,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121219205&doi=10.1016%2fj.infsof.2021.106783&partnerID=40&md5=c424da6e060e9afbc9a9944ba5947299,"Context: Code smells are symptoms of wrong design decisions or coding shortcuts that may increase defect rate and decrease maintainability. Research on code smells is accelerating, focusing on code smell detection and using code smells as defect predictors. Recent research shows that even between software developers, agreement on what constitutes a code smell is low, but several publications claim the high performance of detection algorithms—which seems counterintuitive, considering that algorithms should be taught on data labeled by developers. Objective: This paper aims to investigate the possible reasons for the inconsistencies between studies in the performance of applied machine learning algorithms compared to developers. It focuses on the reproducibility of existing studies. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed among conference and journal articles published between 1999 and 2020 to assess the state of reproducibility of the research performed in those papers. A quasi-gold standard procedure was used to validate the search. Modeling process descriptions, reproduction scripts, data sets, and techniques used for their creation were analyzed. Results: We obtained data from 46 publications. 22 of them contained a detailed description of the modeling process, 17 included any reproduction data (data set, results, or scripts) and 15 used existing data sets. In most of the publications, analyzed projects were hand-picked by the researchers. Conclusion: Most studies do not include any form of an online reproduction package, although this has started to change recently—8% of analyzed studies published before 2018 included a full reproduction package, compared to 22% in years 2018–2019. Ones that do include a package usually use a research group website or even a personal one. Dedicated archives are still rarely used for data packages. We recommend that researchers include complete reproduction packages for their studies and use well-established research data archives instead of their own websites. © 2021 The Authors",Review,Final,Scopus

Such a large number of studies hinders the community from understanding the current research landscape. This paper aims to summarize the current knowledge in applied machine learning for source code analysis. We review studies belonging to twelve categories of software engineering tasks and corresponding machine learning techniques, tools, and datasets that have been applied to solve them. To do so, we conducted an extensive literature search and identified 494 studies. We summarize our observations and findings with the help of the identified studies. Our findings suggest that the use of machine learning techniques for source code analysis tasks is consistently increasing. We synthesize commonly used steps and the overall workflow for each task and summarize machine learning techniques employed. We identify a comprehensive list of available datasets and tools useable in this context.

Significant efforts in the literature have focused on early-time modifications of (Formula presented.) CDM, introducing new physics operating prior to recombination and reducing the sound horizon. In this opinion paper I argue that early-time new physics alone will always fall short of fully solving the Hubble tension. I base my arguments on seven independent hints, related to (1) the ages of the oldest astrophysical objects, (2) considerations on the sound horizon-Hubble constant degeneracy directions in cosmological data, (3) the important role of cosmic chronometers, (4) a number of “descending trends” observed in a wide variety of low-redshift datasets, (5) the early integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect as an early-time consistency test of (Formula presented.) CDM, (6) early-Universe physics insensitive and uncalibrated cosmic standard constraints on the matter density, and finally (7) equality wavenumber-based constraints on the Hubble constant from galaxy power spectrum measurements. I argue that a promising way forward should ultimately involve a combination of early- and late-time (but non-local—in a cosmological sense, i.e., at high redshift) new physics, as well as local (i.e., at (Formula presented.)) new physics, and I conclude by providing reflections with regards to potentially interesting models which may also help with the (Formula presented.) tension. © 2023 by the author.",Article,Final,Scopus

The authors assumed that for people interested in prayer during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Internet served as a virtual prayer book. The main research questions addressed the frequency of typed queries, referring not only to the word “prayer” but also to specific types of prayer. In addition, interest in prayer was compared with interest in the word “prophecy” to explore the relationship between religiosity and interest in the supernatural sphere in its broadest sense. The analysis shows that there is distinct recurrence regarding the terms searched, with some of them noticeably intensifying with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings also show that keywords related to prophecies were searched more frequently at significant moments in Polish history (2005—the death of John Paul II, 2010—the plane crash in which the President of Poland died) than in the months of 2020 when the pandemic struck and escalated. At that time, searches related to religion were more frequent. It can also be concluded that the outbreak of the pandemic contributed to an increase in the religious activity of Poles.

Design science is recognized as an appropriate research paradigm for applied research, but is rarely explicitly used as a way to present planned or achieved research contributions in software engineering. Applying the design science lens to software engineering research may improve the assessment and communication of research contributions. Aim: The aim of this study is 1) to understand whether the design science lens helps summarize and assess software engineering research contributions, and 2) to characterize different types of design science contributions in the software engineering literature. Method: In previous research, we developed a visual abstract template, summarizing the core constructs of the design science paradigm. In this study, we use this template in a review of a set of 38 award winning software engineering publications to extract, analyze and characterize their design science contributions. Results: We identified five clusters of papers, classifying them according to their different types of design science contributions.

An international group of multidisciplinary author teams were assembled for the topic reviews using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses format, and completed sections underwent a thorough and iterative consensus-building process. The final document underwent rigorous synthesis and review prior to publication. Results: The ICSNT document consists of four major sections: general principles, benign neoplasms and lesions, malignant neoplasms, and quality of life and surveillance. It covers 48 conceptual and/or histopathology-based topics relevant to sinonasal neoplasms and masses. Topics with a high level of evidence provided specific recommendations, while other areas summarized the current state of evidence. A final section highlights research opportunities and future directions, contributing to advancing knowledge and community intervention. Conclusion: As an embodiment of the multidisciplinary and collaborative model of care in sinonasal neoplasms and masses, ICSNT was designed as a comprehensive, international, and multidisciplinary collaborative endeavor. Its primary objective is to summarize the existing evidence in the field of sinonasal neoplasms and masses. © 2023 The Authors.

Under the harsh invisible hand of evolution, natural organisms have evolved for millions of years in a continuous struggle for survival, and as such they represent locally optimal responses to their environment. It is readily apparent that biological systems are hugely successful in solving engineering problems: naturally 'engineered' systems are usually far, far in advance of what humans are currently capable of, and can typically be characterised by superb robustness and an astounding degree of co-evolved multifunctionality and integration. It is also important to remember that biological systems do not occupy some special space denied to engineers: they function under the same physical rules and constraints as human-engineered systems. It is therefore self-evident that engineers have much to learn from nature. This is becoming steadily more appreciated, and the extraction of engineering principles from biological systems (the field known as Biomimetics) is becoming an increasingly popular approach to solving contemporary engineering problems. This increased popularity is also a consequence of the recent primacy of biology among the natural sciences, and the perceived need for engineered systems to increasingly act in accordance with nature. However, the use of nature as a source of inspiration for engineers and architects in fact has a very long history: examples from antiquity include the aviomorphic flying machines of da Vinci and the loadbearing structure of the Eiffel Tower. It is therefore natural at this time to consider the application of biomimetic technology to astronautical engineering. At first consideration, the notion of borrowing from terrestrial life forms to provide solutions for engineering a system to operate within a non-terrestrial environment might not seem like a good idea. However, space exploration places unique requirements upon engineering which actually increase the desirability of trying to replicate certain characteristics of biological organisms: the environments to be explored are harsh, and to a greater or lesser extent undefined beforehand; resupply or maintenance are usually impossible, so there is a requirement for extreme resource and energy efficiency (including an active benefit in being able to utilise resources in situ); there are typically long communication delays between the ground segment and the spacecraft, incompatibly coupled with a frequent requirement for intense short-term activity during crucial mission phases; and due to the requirement to extract as much utility from a mission as possible, there is also a requirement for highly concurrent activity and therefore effective management between functions. Characteristics that are common to biological systems include robustness, autonomy, adaptability, intelligence, energy efficiency (including an unparalleled ability to utilise environmental sources of energy), and the ability to self-repair, self-heal and evolve. It is immediately obvious that engineering these characteristics into a space mission is highly desirable, given the constraints outlined above. Consequently, there would appear to be good reasons for considering biomimetic solutions when designing missions to operate in the space environment. This publication summarises a two-year study performed within the Advanced Concepts Team (ACT) into the potential application of biomimetic engineering to the future activity of the European Space Agency. The documents that were used as background information are listed in part I section 1.4. The overall goals of the study were: To evaluate the application of biomimetic technology to space in general, and in particular to identify areas of ESA activity which are likely to benefit from the application of biomimetic technology To provide ESA engineers with resources to enable them to access biomimetic concepts and expertise To evaluate at a conceptual level the application of some promising biomimetic technologies and concepts through specific case studies To develop recommendations for future ESA activities concerning Biomimetics The range of extant biomimetic technologies have been systematically assessed, specifically with regard to their application to near-term and future ESA activity. This has been achieved through a mapping process between 'Dossier 0'*, the ESA Technology Tree, and a Biomimetic Technology Tree designed by the Advanced Concepts Team. The areas of ESA activity to which biomimetic engineering has been found to have the most potential to contribute are the following: On-board autonomy and intelligence for spacecraft Autonomous GN&C of spacecraft Autonomous GN&C for formation-flying spacecraft On-orbit servicing and assembly of large structures Folding, packing and deployment of large structures Control and monitoring of ECLSS ISRU system implementation Crew health monitoring Planetary exploration Health monitoring for critical systems However, there exist many other instances where biomimetic solutions could offer superior performance to more traditional engineering solutions. For example, the current movement towards biologically-inspired solutions in computer and telecommunications networking, and the huge range of biomimetic materials research that is currently underway, represent two considerable sources of inspiration for space engineers. Because biomimetic solutions can exist in nearly any area of engineering, and because the number of these solutions is growing rapidly, a database (www.bionics2Space.org) has been developed to allow ESA engineers (and others) to access two information sets: The current research expertise in biomimetic engineering worldwide A growing database of biomimetic solutions to specific engineering problems The database has been constructed around the 'theory of inventive problem solving' (TRIZ) methodology to allow the engineer to specify a particular engineering problem and search both for systems from the natural world, and for existing biomimetic engineering solutions that address this problem. Working from those areas of ESA activity that have a high degree of biomimetic 'fit', a number of specific applications of biomimetic technology to space have been assessed in short case studies. These case studies range from potentially near-term scenarios, which can lead to technology development in the short-term, to consideration of very long-term scenarios where biomimetic technology might have a transformational impact. The purpose of the case studies has been to demonstrate the potential application of biomimetic technology to ESA activity, and also to evaluate (where appropriate) the benefits - or not, as the case may be - of a biomimetic solution compared with more traditional approaches. Specifically, work from the following studies is considered in this document: A spherical 'tumbleweed' rover for the Martian surface that relies on a combination of passive wind-propelled locomotion and an active internal ballast system that allows power generation during passive locomotion, and also active and directed locomotion through centre of mass displacement (see part III chapter 2) The application of hypometabolic stasis (hibernation) to humans for long duration spaceflight. This study has addressed the possibility of inducing a hypometabolic state in astronauts on long-duration space missions, to drastically reduce their physiological and psychological requirements (see part III chapter 3) Self assembly in space using a behaviour-based swarm-intelligence approach. In this study, a distributed control methodology inspired by swarm intelligence has been developed to allow the construction of an arbitrary structure in space from intelligent structural components. More specifically, the control methodology relies on the construction of a dynamical system composed of three basis-behaviours (see part III chapter 4) A hexapod rover for the Martian surface relying on an evolutionary neural-network approach to control, passive mechanical compliance through preflexes, and an emphasis on co-evolution of structural morphology and control systems (see part III chapter 5) Lightweight biomimetic digging and drilling mechanisms based on the ovipositors of the locust (Locusta migratoria) and the wood wasp (Urocerus gigas) (see part III chapter 6) These studies demonstrate in some small part the potential application of biomimetic technology to a range of future ESA missions and activities. Biomimetically-engineered space systems have the potential to be lighter, stronger, smarter, tougher, leaner and more efficient (by any metric) than anything previously developed. This is particularly true in the field of biomimetic robotics, which brings together many biomimetic technologies (artificial muscles, behavioural control, biomimetic morphology etc.): the development of planetary rovers with 'natural' levels of performance in terms of autonomy, locomotive and manipulative capability, energy efficiency, robustness and self-repair would represent a step change in remote exploration. Further into the future, such exotic concepts as mimicking hibernators by inducing hypometabolism in astronauts have a potentially mission-enabling impact on a broad range of manned mission classes. To summarise, biomimicry has the potential to provide solutions superior to those of more traditional engineering techniques, across a wide range of ESA activities. As a final caveat, biomimetic solutions should of course not be allowed primacy just because they are biomimetic and therefore 'in vogue', as they are not always going to be the best choice. © 2006 European Space Agency.",Article,Final,Scopus

A composite refactoring (or, simply, composite) is defined by two or more interrelated refactorings, which is often applied by developers. Each composite needs to be somehow represented and has its own characteristics (e.g., code scope) as well as its effects on software quality. However, these basic elements of composites are rarely studied systematically. The lack of systematic knowledge also misguides the design of automated support tools for supporting composite refactoring. Thus, researchers might have controversial views about basic elements of composite refactorings. An example of these literature conflicts concerns the effect of composites: while some studies suggest composites more often remove code smells, other studies indicate composites often introduce code smells. Objective: in this sense, our study aims at analyzing the technical literature of composite refactoring and building a conceptual framework of the representation models, characteristics, and the effect of composite refactoring. Method: we conducted a systematic mapping with 140 primary empirical studies about refactoring. Our systematic mapping summarizes the current knowledge on composites and also presents a conceptual framework intended to characterize composite refactoring. Results: our conceptual framework presents seven representation models, nine characteristics, and thirteen effects of composites. We found out that studies used multidimensional representations, like graphs, to determine what refactoring(s) may be suggested and combined. On composite characteristics, studies mentioned developers often finish a composite in up to a month. However, these studies do not detail why and when composites span for several weeks. Then, we discussed other existing gaps on the current literature of composites. For instance, while most of the studies report the effect of composites on internal software quality, e.g., code smells, their effect on external software quality is little explored. Conclusion: our results can motivate future studies to more deeply investigate composite refactoring applications, and the improvement of tooling support for composite refactorings. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Final,Scopus

Over the years, a large number of design techniques have been proposed by both researchers and practitioners. Unfortunately, despite their uniqueness, it is not uncommon to find software products that make subpar design decisions, leading to design degradation challenges. One potential reason for this behavior is that developers do not have a clear vision of how much a code unit could grow; without this vision, a code unit can grow endlessly, even when developers are equipped with an arsenal of design practices. Different than other design techniques, Cognitive Driven Development (CDD for short) focuses on (1) defining and (2) limiting the number of coding elements that developers could use at a given code unit. In this paper, we report on the experiences of a software development team using CDD for building from scratch a learning management tool at Zup Innovation, a Brazilian tech company. By curating commit traces left in the repositories, combined with the developers’ perception, we organized a set of findings and lessons that could be useful for those interested in adopting CDD. For instance, we noticed that by using CDD, despite the evolution of the product, developers were able to keep the code units under a small amount of size (in terms of lines of code). Furthermore, although limiting the complexity is at the heart of CDD, we also discovered that developers tend to relax this notion of limit so that they can cope with the different complexities of the software. Still, we noticed that CDD could also influence testing practices; limiting the code units’ size makes testing easier to perform. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Article,Final,Scopus

As the pandemic has progressed, the understanding of this disease has evolved. Objective: This first in a two-part series on COVID-19 updates provides a focused overview of the presentation and evaluation of COVID-19 for emergency clinicians. Discussion: COVID-19, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Several variants exist, including a variant of concern known as Delta (B.1.617.2 lineage) and the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529 lineage). The Delta variant is associated with higher infectivity and poor patient outcomes, and the Omicron variant has resulted in a significant increase in infections. While over 80% of patients experience mild symptoms, a significant proportion can be critically ill, including those who are older and those with comorbidities. Upper respiratory symptoms, fever, and changes in taste/smell remain the most common presenting symptoms. Extrapulmonary complications are numerous and may be severe, including the cardiovascular, neurologic, gastrointestinal, and dermatologic systems. Emergency department evaluation includes focused testing for COVID-19 and assessment of end-organ injury. Imaging may include chest radiography, computed tomography, or ultrasound.

However, assigning appropriate reviewers to evaluate changed code during the review process remains challenging. While automated tools for reviewer assignments have limited impact in practice, the process often relies on manual investigation of project histories to retrieve knowledge of team members and their activities. Therefore, in this study, we present an approach to automatically assemble developers' information and visualize it meaningfully, which helps to choose appropriate reviewers. First, we propose three metrics that measure developers' collaboration, reviewers' expertise, and reviewers' workload and visualize them through networks. Second, we perform a case study of three popular open-source projects, where we compute and visualize each developers' information according to the proposed metrics. Finally, we conducted two online surveys to assess the developers' perceptions of the proposed visual benefits. The results show that the proposed method can assist in identifying relevant reviewers and be immensely helpful to new developers. Additionally, survey respondents expressed reliance on the efficacy of the visual aids in workload balancing and reducing review time. © 2023 IEEE.",Conference paper,Final,Scopus

H2S belongs to the class of molecules known as gasotransmitters, which typically include nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO). Three enzymes are recognized as endogenous sources of H2S in various cells and tissues: Cystathionine c-lyase (CSE), cystathionine b-synthase (CBS), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST). The present article reviews the regulation of these enzymes as well as the pathways of their enzymatic and nonenzymatic degradation and elimination. The multiple interactions of H2S with other labile endogenous molecules (e.g., NO) and reactive oxygen species are also outlined. Next, the various biological targets and signaling pathways are outlined, with special reference to H2S or oxidative posttranscriptional modification (persulfidation or sulfhydration) of proteins and the effect of H2S on various channels and intracellular second messenger pathways, the regulation of gene transcription and translation, and the regulation of cellular bioenergetics and metabolism. The pharmacological and molecular tools currently available to study H2S physiology are also reviewed, including their utility and limitations. In subsequent sections, the role of H2S in the regulation of various physiological and cellular functions is reviewed, including the regulation of membrane potential, endo- and exocytosis, regulation of various cell organelles (endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, mitochondria), regulation of cell movement, cell cycle, cell differentiation, and physiological aspects of regulated cell death. Next, the physiological roles of H2S in various cell types and organ systems are overviewed, including the role of H2S in red blood cells, immune cells, the central and peripheral nervous systems (with focus on neuronal transmission, learning, and memory formation), and regulation of vascular function (including angiogenesis as well as its specialized roles in the cerebrovascular, renal, and pulmonary vascular beds) and the role of H2S in the regulation of special senses, vision, hearing, taste and smell, and pain-sensing. Finally, the roles of H2S in the regulation of various organ functions (lung, heart, liver, kidney, urogenital organs, reproductive system, bone and cartilage, skeletal muscle, and endocrine organs) are presented, with a focus on physiology (including physiological aging) but also extending to some common pathophysiological conditions. From these data, a wide array of significant roles of H2S in the physiological regulation of all organ functions emerges and the characteristic bell-shaped biphasic effects of H2S are highlighted. In addition, key pathophysiological aspects, debated areas, and future research and translational areas are identified. cell signaling; enzymes; hydrogen sulfide; organ function; posttranslational modifications. © 2023 the American Physiological Society.",Article,Final,Scopus

Now, a day’s machine learning based techniques have been extensively used towards code smell research. The main objective of this research is to optimise the features of Android code smells in terms of software metrics using feature selection technique based on Correlation on 2896 instances of open-source projects which are extracted from GitHub. Further, we have examined the performance measures like accuracy, precision, F-measure and execution time etc. with the reduced features data set of Android code smells. This paper also discussed about implementation of correlation-based feature selection algorithm to reduce the features of code smells. Then, the data has been analyzed with 4 machine learning algorithms that are Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Simple Logistic and Sequential minimal optimization (SMO). The performance metrics for the above-mentioned machine learning algorithms with and without performing the feature selection have been compared. The computed outcome shows that the best accuracy and lesser execution time for all 3 considered Android code smells have been achieved using Logistic Regression algorithm. After feature selection the accuracy has increased up to 16%, 25% and 4.7% for NLMR, MIM and DTWC code smells respectively.

Code smells should be detected as soon as they are introduced, enabling refactoring actions with less effort and time. Non-Interactive Detection (NID) techniques traditionally support code smells detection, enabling developers to reveal smells in later software program versions. NID techniques do not support developers' progressive interaction with smelly code, revealing smells in the entire source code upon an explicit developer request, which might lead to the accumulation of code smells and, consequently, the degradation of software quality. Interactive Detection (ID) has emerged as a solution to overcome NID's limitations. By revealing code smell as soon as they are introduced, developers can detect smell instances earlier, resulting in more effective refactoring actions and improved code quality. However, despite its promising potential, there is a lack of evidence regarding the ID impact on code smell detection and refactoring actions during coding analysis. Our research focused on evaluating the effectiveness of an ID technique in code smell detection. Besides, we analyzed the aid of an ID technique in performing effective refactoring actions during coding analysis. To this end, we conducted a controlled experiment with 16 subjects that underwent tasks related to detecting code smells and judging refactoring actions. The experimental tasks revealed that using the ID technique led to an increase of 60% in recall and up to 13% in precision when detecting code smells. Additionally, developers have effectively identified about 55% more code smells instances using the ID technique. Our study results revealed that using ID can improve the effectiveness of code smells detection, as developers can identify opportunities for refactoring actions earlier when compared to NID.  © 2013 IEEE.",Article,Final,Scopus

Both direct and indirect consequences from COVID-19 infection are recognized to give rise to cardio- and cerebrovascular complications. Despite current limited knowledge on COVID-19 pathogenesis, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and coagulopathy appear to play critical roles in COVID-19-associated cerebrovascular disease (CVD). One of the major subtypes of CVD is cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) which represents a spectrum of pathological processes of various etiologies affecting the brain microcirculation that can trigger subsequent neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Prevalent with aging, CSVD is a recognized risk factor for stroke, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease. In the background of COVID-19 infection, the heightened cellular activations from inflammations and oxidative stress may result in elevated levels of microthrombogenic extracellular-derived circulating microparticles (MPs). Consequently, MPs could act as pro-coagulant risk factor that may serve as microthrombi for the vulnerable microcirculation in the brain leading to CSVD manifestations. This review aims to appraise the accumulating body of evidence on the plausible impact of COVID-19 infection on the formation of microthrombogenic MPs that could lead to microthrombosis in CSVD manifestations, including occult CSVD which may last well beyond the pandemic era. © 2021, The Author(s).",Review,Final,Scopus

Several pathogens are known to alter olfactory responses and behavior in vectors. As a mosquito-borne pathogen, Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) can affect humans and cause great losses in livestock. We test the influence of RVFV infection on sensory perception, olfactory choice behavior and activity on a non-biting insect, Drosophila melanogaster, using electroantennograms (EAG), Y-maze, and locomotor activity monitor. Flies were injected with RVFV MP12 strain. Replication of RVFV and its persistence for at least seven days was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR). One day post injection, infected flies showed weaker EAG responses towards 1-hexanol, vinegar, and ethyl acetate. In the Y-maze, infected flies showed a significantly lower response for 1-hexanol compared to uninfected flies. At days six or seven post infection, no significant difference between infected and control flies could be found in EAG or Y-maze anymore. Activity of infected flies was reduced at both time points. We found an upregulation of the immune-response gene, nitric oxide synthase, in infected flies. An infection with RVFV is able to transiently reduce olfactory perception and attraction towards food-related odors in Drosophila, while effects on activity and immune effector gene expression persist. A similar effect in blood-feeding insects could affect vector competence in RVFV transmitting dipterans. © 2023 by the authors.",Article,Final,Scopus

Generally speaking, an e-nose is mainly composed of two parts: a gas sensing system (gas sensor arrays, gas transmission paths) and an information processing system (microprocessor and related hardware, pattern recognition algorithms). It has been more than 30 years since the e-nose concept was introduced in the 1980s. Since then, e-noses have evolved from being large in size, expensive, and power-hungry instruments to portable, low cost devices with low power consumption. This paper reviews the development of compact e-nose design and calculation over the last few decades, and discusses possible future trends. Regarding the compact e-nose design, which is related to its size and weight, this paper mainly summarizes the development of sensor array design, hardware circuit design, gas path (i.e. the path through which the mixed gases to be measured flow inside the e-nose system) and sampling design, as well as portable design. For the compact e-nose calculation, which is directly related to its rapidity of detection, this review focuses on the development of on-chip calculation and wireless computing.

The growing burden of survivorship is substantial in terms of the complexity of long-term health effects and the number of people affected. Persistent symptoms have been reported in patients with both mild and severe acute COVID-19, including those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Early reports on the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) indicate that fatigue, dyspnoea, cough, headache, loss of taste or smell, and cognitive or mental health impairments are among the most common symptoms. These complex, multifactorial impairments across the domains of physical, cognitive, and mental health require a coordinated, multidisciplinary approach to management. Decades of research on the multifaceted needs of and models of care for patients with post-intensive care syndrome provide a framework for the development of PASC clinics to address the immediate needs of both hospitalised and non-hospitalised survivors of COVID-19. Such clinics could also provide a platform for rigorous research into the natural history of PASC and the potential benefits of therapeutic interventions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Review,Final,Scopus

This work aims to identify the main determinants of food consumption and barriers for healthy eating at the workplace, in a university setting. Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted with 533 participants. Data were obtained through the application of a self-administered questionnaire that included socio-demographic information, food consumption determinants and the main perceived barriers for healthy eating at the workplace. Results: The respondents identified “price” (22.5%), “meal quality” (20.7%), and “location/distance” (16.5%). For women, the determinant “availability of healthy food options” was more important than for men (p < 0.001). The food consumption determinants at the workplace most referred to by respondents were related to the nutritional value. Smell, taste, appearance and texture, and good value for money, were also considered important for choosing food at the workplace. Respondents referred to work commitments and lack of time as the main barriers for healthy eating at the workplace. Conclusions: Identification of determinants involved in food consumption, and the barriers for healthy eating, may contribute to a better definition of health promotion initiatives at the workplace aiming to improve nutritional intake. © 2021 by the authors.

While several molecular targets have been used to study mosquitoes since the initiation of PCR in the 1980s, its application to mosquito identification took off in the early 1990s. This review follows the research's recent journey into the use of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome oxidase 1 (COI or COX1) as a DNA barcode target for mosquito species identification - a target whose utility for discriminating mosquitoes is now escalating. The pros and cons of using a mitochondrial genome target are discussed with a broad sweep of the mosquito literature suggesting that nuclear introgressions of mtDNA sequences appear to be uncommon and that the COI works well for distantly related taxa and shows encouraging utility in discriminating more closely related species such as cryptic/sibling species groups. However, the utility of COI in discriminating some closely related groups can be problematic and investigators are advised to proceed with caution as problems with incomplete lineage sorting and introgression events can result in indistinguishable COI sequences appearing in reproductively independent populations. In these - if not all - cases, it is advisable to run a nuclear marker alongside the mtDNA and thus the utility of the ribosomal DNA - and in particular the internal transcribed spacer 2 - is also briefly discussed as a useful counterpoint to the COI.

Several attempts to mimic biological olfactory systems have led to various artificial olfactory systems using different technical approaches. Here we provide a parallel description of biological olfactory systems and their technical counterparts. We start with a presentation of the input to the systems, the stimuli, and treat the interface between the external world and the environment where receptor neurons or artificial chemosensors reside. We then delineate the functions of receptor neurons and chemosensors as well as their overall input-output (I/O) relationships. Up to this point, our accounts of the systems go along similar lines. The next processing steps differ considerably: Whereas in biology the processing step following the receptor neurons is the “integration” and “processing” of receptor neuron outputs in the olfactory bulb, this step has various realizations in electronic noses. For a long period of time, the signal processing stages beyond the olfactory bulb, i.e., the higher olfactory centers, were little studied. Only recently has there been a marked growth of studies tackling the information processing in these centers. In electronic noses, a third stage of processing has virtually never been considered. In this review, we provide an up-to-date overview of the current knowledge of both fields and, for the first time, attempt to tie them together.

Currently, various refactoring techniques are being used to develop more readable and less complex codes by improving the non-functional attributes of software. Refactoring can further improve code maintainability by applying various techniques to the source code, which in turn preserves the behavior of code. Refactoring facilitates bug removal and extends the capabilities of the program. In this paper, an exhaustive review is conducted regarding bad smells present in source code, applications of specific refactoring methods to remove that bad smell and its effect on software quality. A total of 68 studies belonging to 32 journals, 31 conferences, and 5 other sources that were published between the years 2001 and 2019 were shortlisted. The studies were analyzed based on of bad smells identified, refactoring techniques used, and their effects on software metrics. We found that ""long method"", ""feature envy"", and ""data class"" bad smells were identified or corrected in the majority of studies. ""Feature envy"" smell was detected in 36.66% of the total shortlisted studies. Extract class refactoring approach was used in 38.77% of the total studies, followed by the move method and extract method techniques that were used in 34.69% and 30.61% of the total studies, respectively. The effects of refactoring on complexity and coupling metrics of software were also analyzed in the majority of studies, i.e., 29 studies each. Interestingly, the majority of selected studies (41%) used large open source datasets written in Java language instead of proprietary software.

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the existing evidence to assess the extent to which alcohol consumption is associated with breast cancer recurrence and second primary breast cancer. Methods Six databases (Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science) were searched using the following search phrase: (breast cancer OR breast adenocarcinoma OR breast neoplasm OR breast tumour) AND (alcohol? OR alcohol intake OR alcohol consumption OR ethanol) AND (recurrence OR second primary). A narrative synthesis was conducted on studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Results After screening, 16 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 11 assessed breast cancer recurrence and 5 assessed second primary breast cancer. Considerable clinical and methodological heterogeneity was observed between studies. Approximately half of the included studies observed a modest, but significant, association between alcohol consumption and increased risk of breast cancer recurrence or development of a second primary breast cancer, with some studies observing associations from as little as six grams of alcohol intake per day. Two studies suggest this association was stronger in postmenopausal women. Conclusion There is some evidence that alcohol consumption increases the risk of breast cancer recurrence, particularly in postmenopausal women. The association between alcohol and development of a second primary breast cancer is less clear.

In this paper, a systematic literature review (SLR) on machine learning-based software defect severity prediction was conducted in the last decade. The SLR was aimed at detecting germane areas central to efficient predictive analytics, which are seldom captured in existing software defect severity prediction reviews. The germane areas include the analysis of techniques or approaches which have a significant influence on the threats to the validity of proposed models, and the bias-variance tradeoff considerations techniques in data science-based approaches. A population, intervention, and outcome model is adopted for better search terms during the literature selection process, and subsequent quality assurance scrutiny yielded fifty-two primary studies. A subsequent thoroughbred systematic review was conducted on the final selected studies to answer eleven main research questions, which uncovers approaches that speak to the aforementioned germane areas of interest. The results indicate that while the machine learning approach is ubiquitous for predicting software defect severity, germane techniques central to better predictive analytics are infrequent in literature.

It is the task of identifying design problems. The significant causes of code smell are complexity in code, violation of programming rules, low modelling, and lack of unit-level testing by the developer. Different open source systems like JEdit, Eclipse, and ArgoUML are evaluated in this work. After collecting the data, the best features are selected using recursive feature elimination (RFE). In this paper, the authors have used different anomaly detection algorithms for efficient recognition of dirty code. The average accuracy value of k-means, GMM, autoencoder, PCA, and Bayesian networks is 98%, 94%, 96%, 89%, and 93%. The k-means clustering algorithm is the most suitable algorithm for code detection. Experimentally, the authors proved that ArgoUML project is having better performance as compared to Eclipse and JEdit projects. Copyright © 2021, IGI Global.

On a large number of newly recognized CT, MRI, and PET characteristics of brain metastases from different primary tumors are highlighted, thereby elucidating the potential differential diagnostic role of CT perfusion imaging, MR spectroscopy, MR diffusion-weighted imaging, MR susceptibility-weighted imaging, and PET with different radiopharmaceuticals. For example, the different manifestations of metastases of melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and ovarian cancer on MRI and CT perfusion imaging are described, and the role of MR susceptibility-weighted imaging in the differential diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme and metastatic tumors is clarified. Metastases of colon cancer have shown a special manifestation on T2 weighted images. The book also presents novel findings regarding pathogenesis and tumor biology and describes qualitative and quantitative changes in tumor tissue and alterations in brain white matter due to surrounding tumor growth. Neuroradiologists and others, including neurosurgeons, neurologists, and nuclear medicine physicians, will find that this book offers a fascinating insight into the ways in which newly available data on structural, hemodynamic, and metabolic changes are enriching the neuroimaging of brain metastases. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",Book,Final,Scopus

In modern software-intensive systems the number of design decisions taken, the dependencies between those decisions, and the number of design alternatives considered, complicate software maintenance and jeopardize the system's longevity. Despite the existence of complexity metrics applied to code, there is a lack of metrics for design decisions. As estimating the complexity of a set of design decisions is needed for understanding the difficulty of software evolution, this paper proposes and validates a new metric to estimate the complexity of decision networks. The metric is based on decision topologies and provides a way to understand the complexity of decision sets and reason about the maintenance difficulty. We validate our metric empirically in two different ways: (i) evaluating the complexity of two service-based platform systems, and (ii) analyzing the evolution of complexity in four open-source projects and compare how the evolution of complexity affects to the architecture in one of the open-source projects. Our results show that certain network topologies are more difficult to maintain, so we provide a set of tactics to reduce the complexity of design decision networks. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Eosinophilic inflammation is described as a common endotype. The anti-IL5 antibody mepolizumab was approved in November 2021 as an add-on therapy to intranasal glucocorticosteroids for the treatment of adults with severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps when systemic glucocorticosteroids or surgery do not provide adequate disease control. While national and international recommendations exist for the use of mepolizumab in CRSwNP, it has not yet been adequately specified how this therapy is to be monitored, what follow-up documentation is necessary, and when it should be terminated if necessary. Methods A literature search was performed to analyze previous data on the treatment of CRSwNP with mepolizumab and to determine the available evidence by searching Medline, Pubmed, the national and international trial and guideline registries and the Cochrane Library. Human studies published in the period up to and including 10/2022 were considered. Results Based on the international literature and previous experience by an expert panel, recommendations for follow-up, adherence to therapy intervals and possible therapy breaks, as well as termination of therapy when using mepolizumab for the indication CRSwNP in the German health care system are given on the basis of a documentation sheet. Conclusions Understanding the immunological basis of CRSwNP opens up new non-surgical therapeutic approaches with biologics for patients with severe, uncontrolled courses. Here, we provide recommendations for follow-up, adherence to therapy intervals, possible therapy pauses, or discontinuation of therapy when mepolizumab is used as add-on therapy with intranasal glucocorticosteroids to treat adult patients with severe CRSwNP that cannot be adequately controlled with systemic glucocorticosteroids and/or surgical intervention. © 2023 Georg Thieme Verlag.

Although COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is primarily a respiratory disease, an increasing number of neurologic symptoms have been reported. Some of these symptoms, such as loss of smell or taste, are mild and non-life threatening, while others, such as stroke or seizure, are more critical. Many of these symptoms remain long after the acute illness has passed, a phenomenon known as “long COVID” or postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). Neurological symptoms can be difficult to study due to the complexity of the central and peripheral nervous system. These neurologic symptoms can be difficult to identify and quantitate. This narrative review will describe approaches for assessing neurologic manifestations of COVID-19, with examples of the data they provide, as well as some directions for future research to aid in understanding the pathophysiology of COVID-19-related neurological implications. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Review,Final,Scopus
