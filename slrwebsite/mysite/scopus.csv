Improvement in technology enables us to design these with greater flexibility and provide greater value to the driver (human centered design). To achieve this, research is required by laboratories, automobile and auto parts manufacturers. Although there has been a lot of effort in human factors research and development, starting from basic research to product development, the knowledge and experience has not been integrated optimally. The aim of this book is to collect and review the information for researchers, designers and developers to learn and apply them for further research and development of human centered design of future automotive technologies. Automotive human factors include psychological, physiological, mathematical, engineering and even sociological aspects. This book offers valuable insights to applying the right approach in the right place. © 2019 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved."	Book	Final	Scopus

Yet for millions of people with motor impairments, children, and older users, pointing-whether with a mouse cursor, a stylus, or a finger on a touch screen-remains a major access barrier because of the fine-motor skills required. In a series of projects inspired by and contributing to ability-based design, we have reconsidered the nature and assumptions behind pointing, resulting in changes to how mouse cursors work, the types of targets used, the way interfaces are designed and laid out, and even how input devices are used. The results from these explorations show that people with motor difficulties can acquire targets in graphical user interfaces when interfaces are designed to better match the abilities of their users. Ability-based design, as both a design philosophy and a design approach, provides a route to realizing a future in which people can utilize whatever abilities they have to express themselves not only to machines, but to the world. © 2014 by IGI Global.

Because of the significant ramifications of falls, many interventions have been proposed, but few have aimed to prevent falls via an integrated approach targeting both motor and cognitive function. We aimed to test the hypothesis that an intervention combining treadmill training with non-immersive virtual reality (VR) to target both cognitive aspects of safe ambulation and mobility would lead to fewer falls than would treadmill training alone. Methods We carried out this randomised controlled trial at five clinical centres across five countries (Belgium, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, and the UK). Adults aged 60–90 years with a high risk of falls based on a history of two or more falls in the 6 months before the study and with varied motor and cognitive deficits were randomly assigned by use of computer-based allocation to receive 6 weeks of either treadmill training plus VR or treadmill training alone. Randomisation was stratified by subgroups of patients (those with a history of idiopathic falls, those with mild cognitive impairment, and those with Parkinson's disease) and sex, with stratification per clinical site. Group allocation was done by a third party not involved in onsite study procedures. Both groups aimed to train three times per week for 6 weeks, with each session lasting about 45 min and structured training progression individualised to the participant's level of performance. The VR system consisted of a motion-capture camera and a computer-generated simulation projected on to a large screen, which was specifically designed to reduce fall risk in older adults by including real-life challenges such as obstacles, multiple pathways, and distracters that required continual adjustment of steps. The primary outcome was the incident rate of falls during the 6 months after the end of training, which was assessed in a modified intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who were assigned a treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01732653. Findings Between Jan 6, 2013, and April 3, 2015, 302 adults were randomly assigned to either the treadmill training plus VR group (n=154) or treadmill training alone group (n=148). Data from 282 (93%) participants were included in the prespecified, modified intention-to-treat analysis. Before training, the incident rate of falls was similar in both groups (10·7 [SD 35·6] falls per 6 months for treadmill training alone vs 11·9 [39·5] falls per 6 months for treadmill training plus VR). In the 6 months after training, the incident rate was significantly lower in the treadmill training plus VR group than it had been before training (6·00 [95% CI 4·36–8·25] falls per 6 months; p<0·0001 vs before training), whereas the incident rate did not decrease significantly in the treadmill training alone group (8·27 [5·55–12·31] falls per 6 months; p=0·49). 6 months after the end of training, the incident rate of falls was also significantly lower in the treadmill training plus VR group than in the treadmill training group (incident rate ratio 0·58, 95% CI 0·36–0·96; p=0·033). No serious training-related adverse events occurred. Interpretation In a diverse group of older adults at high risk for falls, treadmill training plus VR led to reduced fall rates compared with treadmill training alone.

Indeed, most of the software development projects designed for senior citizens rely on the designers’ assumptions of the users’ cognitive models, presenting the risk of falling into stereotypes and leading to products that end up not being used, which reinforces the need to involve older adults in the co-design process. This review of studies published in the last six years in the Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases aims to understand the effectiveness of the application of co-design techniques in senior citizens. One hundred and forty-six eligible articles from a sample of 534 met inclusion criteria. Focus groups, Questionnaires, Low-fidelity/Paper Prototyping; Scenario-building, and Cultural Probes have been the most used techniques applied in this age segment. A set of recommendations was formulated such as the need to explain the technological terms prior to creative activities, involving the creation of technological artifacts and devoting time to create a sense of trust with the participants. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

It is increasingly difficult to perform basic functions like hailing a cab, paying a bill, keeping in touch with loved ones, or remaining engaged with one’s social, cultural, and political networks without first navigating the complex material and symbolic world of modern communication technologies. Research has demonstrated that the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has the potential to facilitate the transcendence of social and spatial barriers, and that targeted interventions have the potential to motivate older adults to stay connected. But, for these actions to be realized as material gains in psychological or physiological well-being, one has to understand the complex mental processes that motivate and shape older adults’ technology use. We synthesize research, both theoretical and applied, across a range of disciplines in an attempt to sketch a portrait of seniors’ dynamic relationship with technology. We aim to highlight research that analyzes the needs and motivations that bring older adults into relationships with technology and the barriers to adoption that stifle the development of these human-machine partnerships. We summarize studies that examine the psychological mechanisms that underlie, and the subsequent effects of, seniors’ technology use, in the hope of furnishing a broad framework for understanding older adults’ rapidly evolving relationship with ICTs. In addition, we aim to provide suggestions that might orient future research and design of technology to facilitate a more active and productive correspondence between aging populations and their technological counterparts. © 2021 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved."

Indeed, the mainstream game industry has been challenged with the emergence of an older target group, the advancements in gamification and the proliferation of SMART devices. Previous experience in the field has revealed that for many older adult gamers, games had a therapeutic effect through them being both cognitively challenged and rewarded. However it has also revealed that the gaming industry was not fulfilling their other motivations and accessibility needs. Furthermore, research to date has focused on the physical and cognitive effects of video games in the aging process. Up to now, the use of other active ageing dimensions that go beyond the health domains (i.e. sense of security, and participation in society) in games addressed to this target group remain unexplored. Topics discussed in the book include: Development of products for the Silver Market; The older adult consumer and the advertisement industry; Differences between informational literacy and digital inclusion; Lifestyle-monitoring technologies and technological determinism; Positive computing and behavioral design; Game Design and Active Ageing; Application of games in rehabilitation; Gamification, Senior Tourism and the wellness market; Techniques used for assessing games for active ageing This book differs from current books on the market by focusing on games and the main implications to design for active ageing in terms of the market perspective, the information and communication society, behavioral design, mobility, urban and city planning, accessibility and assessment. The information presented in this book not only relies on case studies but also on the authors' previous experience in co-designing digitally-mediated products with both adult learners at the Universities of the Third Age and older adults at retirement homes. © 2021 River Publishers."

In order to lay out the research area of interest, a review of the literature on systems that provide exergames for the elderly utilizing such technologies was conducted. The proposed use of augmented reality exergames on mobile devices as a complement to the traditional Kinect-based approach is a method that has been examined in the past with younger individuals in the context of physical activity interventions, but has not been studied adequately as an exergame tool for the elderly. An evaluation study was conducted with seniors, using multiple measuring scales to assess aspects such as usability, tolerability, applicability, and technology acceptance. In particular, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model was used to assess acceptance and identify factors that influence the seniors’ intentions to use the game platform in the long term, while the correlation between UTAUT factors was also investigated.

These challenges are often due to the lack of knowledge of seniors' game preferences and technology literacy as well as a poor involvement of the target population in the design process. Objective: This research aims at describing a detailed and scrutinized use case of applying human-centered design methodologies in the gamification of fitness training routines and illustrates how to incorporate seniors' feedback in the game design pipeline. Materials and Methods: We focus on how to use the insights from human-centered inquiries to improve in-game elements, such as mechanics or esthetics, and how to iterate the game design process based on playtesting sessions in the field. Results: We present a set of four Exergames created to train the critical functional fitness areas of older adults. We show how through rapid prototyping methods and multidisciplinary research, Exergames can be rigorously designed and developed to match individual physical capabilities. Moreover, we propose a set of guidelines for the design of context-aware Exergames based on the lessons learned.

Method: We performed a literature review, based on four databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and Scopus; last search: 30 January 2023). Eligible studies had to use immersive technology with participants aged 60 years and over. The results regarding acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of immersive technology-based interventions in older people were extracted. The standardized mean differences were then computed using a random model effect. Results: In total, 54 relevant studies (1853 participants) were identified through search strategies. Concerning the acceptability, most participants reported a pleasant experience and a desire to use the technology again. The average increase in the pre/post Simulator Sickness Questionnaire score was 0.43 in healthy subjects and 3.23 in subjects with neurological disorders, demonstrating this technology’s feasibility. Regarding the effectiveness, our meta-analysis showed a positive effect of the use of virtual reality technology on balance (SMD = 1.05; 95% CI: 0.75–1.36; p < 0.001) and gait outcomes (SMD = 0.7; 95% CI: 0.14–0.80; p < 0.001). However, these results suffered from inconsistency and the number of trials dealing with these outcomes remains low, calling for further studies. Conclusions: Virtual reality seems to be well accepted by older people and its use with this population is feasible. However, more studies are needed to conclude its effectiveness in promoting exercise in older people. © 2023 by the authors."	Review	Final	Scopus

Its use could allow the assessment of the motor behavior of individuals in adaptable and reproducible immersive environments, simulating real situations. This study aimed to assess the effect of an immersive scenario on functional mobility during a simple locomotor task according to age. Sixty young adults and 60 older volunteers, who were autonomous and without cognitive and neurological impairment participated. A locomotor task based on the “Timed Up and Go” task was performed in real and virtual conditions. A functional mobility score was calculated by combining the time and the number of steps used and compared between young and older people. Results showed that correlations between time and the number of steps were the same in VR and real conditions, but the locomotor performance decreased significantly in VR for both populations. Additionally, older people exhibited a more reduced locomotor performance in a virtual environment than young adults, thereby their functional mobility score decreased more to complete the task, reflecting the adoption of a more secure locomotion strategy often related to the fear of falling, with an increase in time and number of steps to support balance. The major difference between reality and VR is the visual immersion with an HMD, and visual information is more important in the sensory integration of older people. Therefore, the reduction in visual field and lack of visual exproprioceptive information about the body segments in the virtual environment could explain these results.

In most cases, individuals with dementia experience difficulties interacting with physical and social environments. The purpose of this study was to establish ecological validity and initial construct validity of a fire evacuation Virtual Reality Day-Out Task (VR-DOT) environment based on performance profiles as a screening tool for early dementia. Objective: The objectives were (1) to examine the relationships among the performances of 3 groups of participants in the VR-DOT and traditional neuropsychological tests employed to assess executive functions, and (2) to compare the performance of participants with mild Alzheimer's-type dementia (AD) to those with amnestic single-domain mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy controls in the VR-DOT and traditional neuropsychological tests used to assess executive functions. We hypothesized that the 2 cognitively impaired groups would have distinct performance profiles and show significantly impaired independent functioning in ADL compared to the healthy controls. Methods: The study population included 3 groups: 72 healthy control elderly participants, 65 amnestic MCI participants, and 68 mild AD participants. A natural user interface framework based on a fire evacuation VR-DOT environment was used for assessing physical and cognitive abilities of seniors over 3 years. VR-DOT focuses on the subtle errors and patterns in performing everyday activities and has the advantage of not depending on a subjective rating of an individual person. We further assessed functional capacity by both neuropsychological tests (including measures of attention, memory, working memory, executive functions, language, and depression). We also evaluated performance in finger tapping, grip strength, stride length, gait speed, and chair stands separately and while performing VR-DOTs in order to correlate performance in these measures with VR-DOTs because performance while navigating a virtual environment is a valid and reliable indicator of cognitive decline in elderly persons. Results: The mild AD group was more impaired than the amnestic MCI group, and both were more impaired than healthy controls. The novel VR-DOT functional index correlated strongly with standard cognitive and functional measurements, such as mini-mental state examination (MMSE; rho=0.26, P=.01) and Bristol Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale scores (rho=0.32, P=.001). Conclusions: Functional impairment is a defining characteristic of predementia and is partly dependent on the degree of cognitive impairment. The novel virtual reality measures of functional ability seem more sensitive to functional impairment than qualitative measures in predementia, thus accurately differentiating from healthy controls. We conclude that VR-DOT is an effective tool for discriminating predementia and mild AD from controls by detecting differences in terms of errors, omissions, and perseverations while measuring ADL functional ability. © 2013 JMIR Publications Inc.

The continuous decline in fertility rates and increased life expectancy have resulted in an ongoing demographic transition where the share of adults aged 65 or older is increasing and outnumbering children younger than five years. In the United States and other developed countries, this rapid demographic transition is expected to continue to strain the existing health infrastructure as it becomes increasingly challenging to ensure healthy living environments for older adults. The ten questions and answers in this paper have been prepared by experts from gerontology, geriatrics, architectural engineering, and senior living operations to inform and characterize the current continuum of living environments and communities available to older adults. They also identify the common elements that influence the environmental needs of older adults and highlight factors (such as technical assistance, health equity gaps, and caregiver workforce development) that challenge the future of smart and healthy built environments for older adults. A special focus has been placed on contextualizing indoor environmental quality (IEQ) elements and smart building technologies for older individuals, caregivers, and their various requirements (perhaps in their own homes and communities). Together, these viewpoints create a new paradigm to assist in designing and managing intelligent, healthy built environments that respond to human demands. Although this paper focuses on factors in the United States, others can benefit from the framework incubated upon these experiences, making this effort relevant toward addressing global opportunities in environments for older adults. © 2023 The Authors"	Article	Final	Scopus

It is concerned with issues such as informed consent, autonomy, justice, beneficence, non-maleficence, and respect for persons and seeks to balance the interests of individuals, communities, and society. Defining the bioethics of displacement presents a challenge; despite bioethicists efforts to raise multidisciplinarity, the truth is that narrow medical bioethics focused on health is currently mainstream. Bioethics of Displacement and Its Implications defines the bioethics of displacement, explains why it is necessary, and sets the basic curricula on the bioethics of displacement. This book puts displacement in context through historical reflections and stresses how psychological inflexibility and the politics of pain work are reflected in the context of bioethics both in the nature of the research and in bioethics as a force of displacement and the challenges in the bioethical discourse. Finally, the book frames the bioethics of displacement (Bodi) in the modern bioethics discourse and how it can become a game changer. This work focuses on bioethics, confinement, displacement, global public health, and politics.

Cognitive and affective BCIs can offer a deep understanding of brain mechanisms, which may improve learning strategies and increase brain-based skills. They can offer a better empirical foundation for teaching-learning methodologies, including adjusting learning content based on brain workload, measuring student interest of a topic, or even helping students focus on specific tasks. The latest findings from emerging BCI technology, neuroscience, cognitive sciences, and psychology could be used in learning and teaching strategies to improve student abilities in education. This study investigates and analyzes the research on BCI patterns and its implementation for enhancing cognitive capabilities of students. The results showed that there is insufficient literature on BCI that addresses students with disabilities in the learning process. Further, our analysis revealed a bias toward the significance of cognitive process factors compared with other influential factors, such as the learning environment and emotions that influence learning. Finally, we concluded that BCI technology could improve students' learning and cognitive skills - when consistently associated with the different pedagogical teaching-learning strategies - for better academic achievement.  © 2013 IEEE."

Drawing from disciplines ranging from philosophy and evolution to cognition and neuroscience, it examines myriad aspects of the brain’s creative development: the cognitive, sensory, and motor processes that enable technological progress and its resulting efficiencies and deficiencies along with our discomforts and pleasures. These experiences are key to behavioral and affective processes in technology, manifest in such diverse phenomena as multitasking, the shift in tech design from ergonomics to hedonomics, and the many types of online problem behaviors. Through these rich pages, readers can understand more deeply the history and future of human adjustment and adaptation in an environment intertwined with technology-and, with the ascendance of video games and virtual reality, new conceptions of the human self. Among the topics covered: Could we have remained a tech-devoid society? Technology, ergonomics and the non-executive functions of our body. New directions in brain-computer interface. From avatars and agents to virtual reality technology. On measuring affective responses to objects. Psychology, technology, ethics, and culture. A timely lens on a field that will grow in importance as it shapes our existence, Psychology of Technology will be read and discussed by not only psychologists, social scientists, and behavioral scientists, but also by technology designers and developers and those in biotechnology. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."

Design: An integrative literature review. Methods: A search strategy captured 55 eligible articles from databases (CINAHL, Embase, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed) and hand-searching approaches. Bibliometric and content analyses grounded on the health and nursing attributes and human-computer interaction framework were performed using MAXQDA. Finally, results were verified using critical friend feedback by a second reviewer. Results: Most articles were from multiple authorship, published in non-nursing journals, and originating from developed economies. They primarily focused on applying healthcare robots in practice settings, physical health, and communication tasks. Using the human-computer interaction framework, it was found that older adults frequently served as the primary users while nurses, healthcare providers, and researchers functioned as secondary users and operators. Research articles focused on the usability, functionality, and acceptability of robotic systems. At the same time, theoretical papers explored the frameworks and the value of empathy and emotion in robots, human-computer interaction and nursing models and theories supporting healthcare practice, and gerontechnology. Current robotic systems are less anthropomorphic, operated through real-time direct and supervisory inputs, and mainly equipped with visual and auditory sensors and actuators with limited capability in performing health assessments. Conclusion: Results communicate the need for technological competency among nurses, advancements in increasing healthcare robot humanness, and the importance of conscientious efforts from an interdisciplinary research team in improving robotic system usability and utility for the care of older adults. © 2022"	Review	Final	Scopus

This scoping review aims to present an overview of the current state and trends of clinical studies conducted to determine the benefits of using exergames for healthy aging between 2000 and 2019. We included original studies published in English that use exergames to address common diseases associated with subjects over 60 years. The search was conducted in major electronic databases (PubMed, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Web of Science, ACM Digital Library, and Scopus). At least two reviewers analyzed articles independently based on the inclusion criteria and a pre-defined taxonomy to extract information. Abstracted information was summarized in tables and analyzed by publication date using temporal plots and thematic analysis. A total of 4502 potentially relevant studies were identified and assessed to select 130 articles for analysis. Most studies were randomized controlled trials (70) published in journals (119), in the medical or biological area (101), with the aim of treatment (118), addressing mobility-related conditions (87). Most studies used videogame consoles (56) and commercial games (81). We detected a change in the trend of research with an increasing interest in neurological or mental-related conditions after 2017, accompanied by reports of positive results. Consequently, this represents an important area to continue exploring. We found an opportunity to conduct further analysis and studies to support the benefit of exergaming on improving medical outcomes and their long-term effects. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Starting with the premise that standard batteries-some nearly a century old-lag behind in our era of neuroimaging, genomic studies, psychophysiology, and informatics, it presents digital measures offering more efficient administration, more accurate data, and wider clinical applications. Ecological validity and evidence-based science are key themes in these advances, from virtual environments and assessment of social cognition to the shift toward situational reliability and away from lab-created constructs. These chapters also demonstrate how high-tech assessment tools can complement or supplement traditional pencil-and-paper measures without replacing them outright. This book covers in depth: The evolution of neuropsychological testing over the past century. Current applications of computer-based neuropsychological assessments. The strengths and limitations of simulation technology. The use of teleneuropsychology in reaching remote clients. The potential of gaming technologies in neurocognitive rehabilitation. How technology can transform test data into information useful across specialties. Clinical Neuropsychology and Technology brings neuropsychologists, clinical psychologists, and rehabilitation specialists into the vanguard of assessment measures and processes that will translate into more accurate testing, collaborations between disciplines, and valid and useful outcomes. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

We reviewed 174 HCI publications through a systematic review to examine who is engaged in the design of health technologies for older adults, methods used to engage them, and how different types of participation might impact design directions. Findings highlight that thus far, many identity dimensions have not been explored in HCI aging research.

Human factor issues and the impact of technology on society is a topic that is only growing, and it is essential that it is considered as technology becomes more present in our daily lives. This not only impacts society now but is something to be considered for the future. It is also incredibly important for those in the human factors profession to consider the impact of technology for their work and for the users they are helping design for. Therefore, this topic has immense impact and is important to study from a research perspective to advance the understanding of how technology works, how we work, and how we as humans work within the context of the technology we use. Human Factors Issues and the Impact of Technology on Society examines the role of technology on society with a specific focus on human factors issues and how they are associated with and related to technology use in society. A few highlighted topics within this book are digital health technologies, learning technologies, ethics in social technology, ICT use in businesses, and sustainability. These topics are only a few of examples of how this book analyzes technology in all different facets of society, making it ideal for a wide audience including human factors practitioners, technologists, sociologists, policy makers, teachers, technology developers and designers, business professionals, ethicists, researchers, academicians, students, and anyone else seeking more information on how technology is impacting society through the viewpoint of human factors. © 2021 by IGI Global.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of exergaming on pain and postural control in older people with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Secondary outcomes were technology acceptance, flow experience, perceived physical exertion, expended mental effort and heart rate. Methods: Fifty four older adults (age: 71 ± 5 years) with chronic musculoskeletal pain were randomised into 2 groups. Group 1 received exergaming training using the Interactive Rehabilitation and Exercise System (IREX®). Group 2 undertook traditional gym-based exercise (TGB). Both groups completed twice weekly 40-min exercise sessions for 6 weeks. Perceived pain was measured using a numeric pain rating scale and the Multidimensional Affect and Pain Survey questionnaire. Postural control was measured as sway using a Kistler™ force platform. Technology acceptance was measured with the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology questionnaire and flow experience with the Flow State Scale. Physiological measures of perceived physical exertion, expended mental effort and heart rate were recorded during all sessions. Results: The exergaming group demonstrated significant reductions in pain intensity and thermal pain including a near significant approach in physical engagement in comparison to TGB group. Although no intervention effects on postural control were found, the exergaming group showed significant improvements in three sway measures (AP SD, ML SD and AP range) over time whereas significant improvements in ML range were found in the TGB group. Relating to technology acceptance, significant intervention effects on social influence and behavioural intention were found in the TGB group instead, although both groups demonstrated increases of acceptance over time. Regarding flow experience, concentration at task was significantly influenced in the TGB group and significant increases in flow variables over time were observed in both groups. Significant increases over time in perceived physical exertion and expended mental effort were found in both groups. Conclusion: Our findings support the potential of exergaming to alleviate pain and improve balance in older people with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Both forms of exercise are acceptable, intrinsically motivating and show evidence of benefit to older people with chronic musculoskeletal pain.

Moreover, the adoption of Web based solutions together with the integration of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms could bring countless advantages, both for the patients and the clinical personnel, as allowing the early detection of some pathological conditions, improving the efficacy and adherence to rehabilitation processes, through the personalisation of training sessions, and optimizing the allocation of resources by the healthcare system. The current work proposes a systematic survey of existing solutions in the field of cognitive assessment and training. We evaluate the visualization and interaction technologies commonly adopted and the measures taken to fulfil the need of the pathological target populations. Moreover, we analyze how implemented solutions are validated, i.e. The chosen experimental designs, data collection and analysis. Finally, we consider the availability of the applications and raw data to the large community of researchers and medical professionals and the actual application of proposed solutions in the standard clinical practice. Despite the potential of these technologies, research is still at an early stage. Although the recent release of accessible immersive virtual reality headsets and the increasing interest on vision-based techniques for tracking body and hands movements, many studies still rely on non-immersive virtual reality (67.2%), mainly mobile and personal computers, and standard gaming tools for interactions (41.5%). Finally, we highlight that although the interest of research community in this field is increasingly higher, the sharing of dataset (10.6%) and implemented applications (3.8%) should be promoted and the number of healthcare structures which have successfully introduced the new technological approaches in the treatment of their host patients is limited (10.2%).  © 2013 IEEE."

They may suffer loneliness and social isolation more often than people without disabilities. There is a growing demand for technologies to satisfy the social needs of such user groups. However, evaluating these systems can be challeng-ing due to the extra difficulty of gathering data from people with special needs (e.g., communication barriers involving older adults with dementia and children with autism). Thus, in this systematic review, we focus on studying data gathering methods for evaluating socially assistive systems (SAS). Six academic databases (i.e., Scopus, Web of Science, ACM, Science Direct, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore) were searched, covering articles published from January 2000 to July 2021. A total of 65 articles met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. The results showed that existing SASs most often targeted people with visual impairments, older adults, and children with autism. For instance, a common type of SASs aimed to help blind people perceive social signals (e.g., facial expressions). SASs were most commonly assessed with interviews, questionnaires, and observation data. Around half of the interview studies only involved target users, while the other half also in-cluded secondary users or stakeholders. Questionnaires were mostly used with older adults and people with visual impairments to measure their social interaction, emotional state, and system us-ability. A great majority of observational studies were carried out with users in special age groups, especially older adults and children with autism.

Within Computer Science and Engineering, research investigates how to track PA of older adults for various purposes. We present a systematic review of 204 papers and discuss wearable tracking systems according to their purpose, technological context, and target audience, as well as design and evaluation processes with particular attention to the meaningful involvement of older adults. Our results show that most systems focus on supervising older adults in the context of disease and frailty management. Only few systems focus on supporting older adults by promoting rehabilitation and respecting agency of older adults via self-monitoring PA, or encouraging PA to maintain healthy levels of activity. Moreover, systems are often narrowly limited to walking, although older adults may enjoy a broader range of activities. Likewise, the involvement of older adults in design processes is scarce, and their experience with a given technology is rarely considered relevant for evaluation. In sum, we contribute an overview of wearable technology for tracking older adults' PA, contextualize our findings within recommendations provided by Sports and Rehabilitation Science, and illustrate opportunities for future work.  © 2020 ACM."

In today's digital world, people are more connected than ever before and have the ability to find healthcare information in a way that was not possible in recent years. Mass media and social media have become particularly influential in conveying health information to the public. With the amount of misinformation being spread, coupled with poor health literacy skills, it is imperative that new strategies and policies are undertaken to ensure that patients and the general public receive accurate information and are appropriately educated in order to provide them with the best possible knowledge and care. The Research Anthology on Improving Health Literacy Through Patient Communication and Mass Media provides an overview of the importance of health literacy and the various means to achieve health literacy for patients using several strategies and elements such as patient communication and mass media. The book covers health awareness challenges that have been faced recently and historically and pushes for better patient-provider communication. The book also examines the use of social media, virtual support groups, and technological tools that aid in the facilitation of health knowledge. Covering a range of key topics such as patient safety, health illiteracy, and eHealth, this anthology is crucial for healthcare professionals, researchers, academicians, students, and those interested in understanding the importance of health literacy and how it connects to media and communication. © 2022 by IGI Global.

A set of key solutions for accomplishing this goal is offered by neurotechnologies. These systems can monitor and interpret data related to the central and peripheral nervous systems for understanding the individual conditions, enabling the control and the adaptation of assistive and rehabilitative devices, influencing the nervous system itself and empowering mental processes. Focusing on non-invasive approaches (closer to real-world applications), this chapter describes how adopting these solutions can improve the daily life of seniors and help the translational study of the aging brain in real settings through approaches like the one of neuroergonomics. This manuscript also highlights the potential of neuro-gerontechnologies within emerging frameworks that could enable digital biomarker-based assessment and personalization features. In particular, pervasive solutions of Internet of Things and Minds (IoTM) can make everyday devices truly human-centered (and, in this case, senior-centered). Indeed, a network of systems interpreting a person’s will and needs defines a step-change to properly serve human beings according to their fragilities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

The average US citizen can expect to live 20% of his or her life with a disability. Rehabilitation technologies play a major role in improving the quality of life for people with a disability, yet widespread and highly challenging needs remain. Within the US, a major effort aimed at the creation and evaluation of rehabilitation technology has been the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Centers (RERCs) sponsored by the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research. As envisioned at their conception by a panel of the National Academy of Science in 1970, these centers were intended to take a ""total approach to rehabilitation"", combining medicine, engineering, and related science, to improve the quality of life of individuals with a disability. Here, we review the scope, achievements, and ongoing projects of an unbiased sample of 19 currently active or recently terminated RERCs. Specifically, for each center, we briefly explain the needs it targets, summarize key historical advances, identify emerging innovations, and consider future directions. Our assessment from this review is that the RERC program indeed involves a multidisciplinary approach, with 36 professional fields involved, although 70% of research and development staff are in engineering fields, 23% in clinical fields, and only 7% in basic science fields; significantly, 11% of the professional staff have a disability related to their research. We observe that the RERC program has substantially diversified the scope of its work since the 1970's, addressing more types of disabilities using more technologies, and, in particular, often now focusing on information technologies. RERC work also now often views users as integrated into an interdependent society through technologies that both people with and without disabilities co-use (such as the internet, wireless communication, and architecture). In addition, RERC research has evolved to view users as able at improving outcomes through learning, exercise, and plasticity (rather than being static), which can be optimally timed. We provide examples of rehabilitation technology innovation produced by the RERCs that illustrate this increasingly diversifying scope and evolving perspective. We conclude by discussing growth opportunities and possible future directions of the RERC program. © 2017 The Author(s)."	Review	Final	Scopus

This research describes the design and acceptability of a serious game (CityQuest) aimed at improving balance confidence, spatial navigation, and perceptual function in older adults with the use of a virtual environment and a balance board. Community-dwelling healthy (N = 28) and fall-prone (N = 28) older adults were pseudo-randomly assigned to train with CityQuest or one of two control games developed to evaluate the specific effects of the CityQuest game. Following completion of 10 training sessions, participants completed questionnaires measuring their acceptability of the game as a falls-related intervention, game experience, and subjective cognitive or balance confidence changes associated with the game. The results revealed high acceptance scores of the game and positive game experiences for all three game conditions. Older adults prone to falls reported a greater reduction in fear of falling and greater improvement in vigilance following training, compared to healthy older adults. These findings suggest that a serious game based on VR technology that trains both motor and cognitive processes is perceived to be beneficial and acceptable to healthy and fall-prone older adults. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

The objective of this scoping review was to examine research evidence involving the oldest old (persons 85 years of age or greater) and digital game technology. Materials and Methods: PubMed, CINHAL, and Scopus were searched, and 46 articles were included in this review. Results: Results highlighted that 60 percent of articles were published in gerontological journals, whereas only 8.7 percent were published in computer science journals. No studies focused directly on the oldest old population. Few studies included sample sizes greater than 100 participants. Seven primary and 34 secondary themes were identified, of which Hardware Technology and Assessment were the most common. Conclusions: Existing evidence demonstrates the paucity of studies engaging older adults 85 years of age and above regarding the use of digital gaming and highlights a new understudied cohort for further research focus. Recommendations for future research include intentional recruitment and proportionate representation of participants ?85 years of age, large sample sizes, and explicit mention of specific numbers of participants ?85 years of age, which are necessary to advance knowledge in this area. Integrating a rigorous and robust mixed-methods approach including theoretical perspectives would lend itself to further in-depth understanding and knowledge generation in this field. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016."

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the interest in incorporating digital interactions and virtual reality (VR) technologies into healthcare strategies that target older adults. In this phenomenological study, we share our experience of bringing playful and creative gaming and VR technologies to community-dwelling older adults. With funding from Fonds de recherche du Québec – Société et culture (FRQSC), we created a storefront engAGE living lab (ELL) in a shopping mall in a suburb of Montreal (Quebec, Canada) with a high concentration of older population. In this study we tried to repeat a previous study “finding better games for older adults” that was conducted in a university-based research centre for healthy ageing (PERFORM Centre, Concordia University). In this study, based on experience of three research assistants who ran the study between July-Dec 2022, we evaluated strength, weakness, opportunity, and threats (SWOT) of conducting this research in ELL. We found that passive recruitment of older adults into such studies was challenging. To establish trust and long-term relationships between researchers and participants was an important factor in retaining participants in the study, but it created transactional situations where some participants’ motivations were not related to tested technologies, but to socializing with researchers. This work provides insights into the challenges and opportunities of conducting research in public settings. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

As life expectancy increases, traditional health care systems are facing different challenges in terms of cost reduction and high-quality service delivery capability. New ways to improve older adults' quality of life have been explored, taking advantage of new technological solutions. Our focus is on the integration of technology in clinical treatments to facilitate or deliver psychological interventions meant to improve well-being in older adults. Our aims were to describe the main technology-based interventions supporting seniors' quality of life or psychological well-being and to provide greater clarity to what is described in the current literature as their effects on seniors' cognitive and psychological outcomes and healthcare policies. Methods: We reviewed the scientific literature looking for studies that investigated how technology can be implemented into clinical psychology treatments for older adults. Our search was conducted using the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and CINAHL. The search provided 350 articles, mostly (?90%) dated after 2002. Abstract analysis narrowed the selection to 150 papers, according to their relevance and actuality as judged by a restricted group of independent researchers. Results: Through a thematic analysis, we found that virtual reality (VR), robots, telemedicine, software, video games, and smartphone applications could potentially support older adults' psychological treatment with a positive impact on healthcare systems. Conclusion: Findings from the literature are encouraging, although most of these results are only preliminary. © 2020 The Author(s)."	Review	Final	Scopus

They benefited from neuropsychological testing and electroencephalography before and after the intervention. Our results showed that the SG group improved performance in specific cognitive functions such as working memory, dual task performance and visual conjunction search. The performance improvement was also supported only at the SG group by increased amplitude of the Event Related Potentials extracted from the electroencephalography measures.The results from our study suggest that older adults do not need to be technologically savvy to benefit from virtual reality training. © 2015, IGI Global.

This review aims to understand the role of a new actor, which increasingly plays the role of enabler and facilitator, i.e., that of the technology provider. The review specifically focuses on Information Technology (IT), with a particular emphasis on software applications, and on how IT can prevent decline, compensate for lost capabilities, aid care, and enhance existing capabilities. The analysis confirms the crucial role of IT in Active Ageing, shows that Active Ageing requires a multidisciplinary approach, and identifies the need for better integration of hardware, software, the environment and the involved actors. © 2014 C.

Inflammatory lesions in the brain that are caused by the disease result in gait deficits and increase the risk of fall. Falls induce fear of falling and trigger a vicious circle, which in turn increases the likelihood of falling. Objective of this review was to provide an overview of existing research on the effects of FOF and therapy options in multiple sclerosis. Methods: A systematic search at Web of Science and PubMed was conducted. The search included the terms (fear of falling) OR (concern about falling) OR (fall anxiety) AND (multiple sclerosis). Results: In included studies, FOF was measured by different instruments. The Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) was the most frequently used instrument for pwMS. Patients with a higher FOF score fell more frequently, had lower walking speed, shorter stride length, larger ellipse sway area and a more severe disability. At present, therapeutic offers exist mainly in the field of physiotherapy. For reducing FOF, assisted vibration (dz = 0.68), VR (dz =0.87) and bicycle training (dz = 1.23) were the most effective methods. Conclusion: It is advisable to develop therapies that incorporate both physical and psychological aspects in neurorehabilitation, like in a cognitive behavioral therapy. Moreover, FOF monitoring should be integrated into the clinical routine. © 2020"	Review	Final	Scopus

Technology addressing the aging process of older adults (i.e., gerontechnology) is an avenue for the efficient delivery of programs that enhance adult well-being. Virtual reality (VR) is a type of gerontechnology with the potential to improve mental health and well-being (e.g., by increasing resilience, mindfulness, compassion, connection with nature, and decreasing stress, depression, anxiety); however, evidence in this area is currently lacking and more rigorous research on the acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of mental health programming via VR for older adults, such as nature, mindfulness, or compassion-based interventions, is necessary. The present literature review: 1) explores, synthesizes, and critically evaluates the literature on older adult mental health, well-being and gerontechnology, with a focus on virtual reality-based nature, mindfulness, and compassion-based interventions; 2) examines research to date on the relationship between virtual reality technology and nature, mindfulness, and self-compassion; 3) identifies gaps, contradictions, and limitations of existing research; 4) identifies areas for further investigation; and 5) discusses implications for research and clinical practice.

There is a lack of effective pharmacological treatments for apathy, and nonpharmacological interventions are a preferred first-line approach to treatment. Virtual reality (VR) using head-mounted displays (HMDs) is being successfully used in exposure- and distraction-based therapies; however, there is limited research on using HMDs for symptoms of neurological disorders. Objective: This feasibility study aimed to assess whether VR using HMDs could be used to deliver tailored reminiscence therapy and examine the willingness to participate, response rates to measures, time taken to create tailored content, and technical problems. In addition, this study aimed to explore the immediate effects between verbal fluency and apathy after exposure to VR. Methods: A mixed methods study was conducted in a sample of older adults residing in aged care, and 17 participants were recruited. Apathy was measured using the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), and verbal fluency was used as a proxy measure of improvements in apathy and debriefing interviews to assess feedback from participants. Side effects that can occur from using HMDs were also measured. Results: We recruited participants from a high socioeconomic status setting with a high education level, and the participation rate was 85% (17/20); most responses to measures were positive. Access to a wide range of freely available content and the absence of technical difficulties made the delivery of a VR reminiscence intervention highly feasible. Participants had improved semantic scores (t14=?3.27; P=.006) but not phonemic fluency scores (t14=0.55; P=.59) immediately after the intervention. Those with higher levels of apathy demonstrated the greatest cognitive improvements after a VR reminiscence experience, which was indicated by a strong positive relationship between the AES and semantic verbal fluency change scores postminus pre-VR (r=0.719; 95% CI 0.327 to 0.900; P=.003). All participants enjoyed the experience despite 35% (6/17) of participants experiencing temporary side effects. Conclusions: This study provides initial evidence that it is feasible to use VR with HMDs for therapy to treat symptoms of apathy in older adults in residential aged care. However, there is a need to closely monitor the side effects of HMD use in older adults. Further research is needed using an active control group to compare the use of VR with traditional forms of reminiscence therapy. © Dimitrios Saredakis, Hannah AD Keage, Megan Corlis, Tobias Loetscher.

Criteria for game-elements (GE) selection are insufficiently characterized in terms of their adequacy to patients’ clinical conditions or targeted cognitive outcomes. This study aimed to identify GE applied in GBI for cognitive assessment, training or rehabilitation. A systematic review of literature was conducted. Papers involving video games were included if: (1) presenting empirical and original data; (2) using video games for cognitive intervention; and (3) considering attention, working memory or inhibitory control as outcomes of interest. Ninety-one papers were included. A significant difference between the number of GE reported in the assessed papers and those composing video games was found (p < .001). The two most frequently used GE were: score system (79.2% of the interventions using video games; for assessment, 43.8%; for training, 93.5%; and for rehabilitation, 83.3%) and narrative context (79.2% of interventions; for assessment, 93.8%; for training, 73.9% and for rehabilitation, 66.7%). Usability assessment was significantly associated with six of the seven GE analyzed (p-values between p ? 0.001 and p. = 027). The use of GE that act as extrinsic motivation promotors (e.g., numeric feedback system) may jeopardize patients’ long-term adherence to interventions, mainly if associated with progressive difficulty-increase of gaming experience. Lack of precise description of GE and absence of a theoretical framework supporting GE selection are important limitations of the available clinical literature. © 2019 Elsevier Inc."

Aging brings about potential loss of an individual's function due to disease, injury, or the degenerative nature of aging itself. Three-dimensional virtual environments have been identified as systems with good potential to ameliorate such problems in older individuals, and precise fine motor skills represent an important class of functional skills. Two groups of participants (Young, n=10, mean age 21.3 years, range 20-24, senior, n=10, mean age 70.7 years, range 60-85) performed a reach to grasp in a desktop virtual environment with simple, low contrast graphics. Results indicate that visual feedback of the hand for sensory guidance of movement did not improve motor performance for either group, and that as precision requirements of the task increased, age group differences in movement time and peak grasp aperture also increased. These findings extend the literature on age group differences in human motor control across the lifespan and differ from previous studies which showed presence of visual feedback of the hand improved motor performance in young adults. Differences in luminance contrast levels in past studies and the current one suggest that control over this feature of the visual scene is an important design consideration for all end-users and warrants additional investigation. Additional recommendations for age-specific design of three dimensional user interfaces include usage of tangibles that are sufficient in size to limit detrimental effects for older adults. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd."

This chapter details our approach to applying participatory methods to our work with a group of older adults during series of workshops. The workshops involved working with 25 adults from both regional and metropolitan areas, who were over the age of 70. We referred to these participants as the Technology Explorers. The Technology Explorers partnered with us to explore how Virtual Reality (VR) technology could be harnessed to provide older adults with opportunities to participate in meaningful social activities. This chapter focuses on the initial engagement phase of the project that involved introducing the Technology Explorers to a range of VR systems and interaction techniques, co-designing 3D Avatars, and interacting with each other in two social VR technology probes. We describe the participatory methods that helped us to build a strong collaborative partnership with the Technology Explorers, before detailing the techniques used to engage with group members who had vastly different levels on technical knowledge.

Developing interventions that slow down cognitive decline would greatly benefit the autonomy of these elderly, as well as their caretakers. Virtual reality (VR) is an immersive and interactive human-computer interface with real-time simulation that is suggested to be a promising tool to improve cognitive functioning. This literature review discusses the features of immersive VR, including its opportunities and limitations, that are of special relevance for improving cognition in elderly. First, the high flexibility of VR allows for personalized and safe training of potentially harmful situations and isolated aspects of tasks. Second, VR's dynamic and real-time feedback on performance provides a labor-extensive tool for caretakers in elderly care. Third, the acquisition of high resolution data enables the exposure of subtle changes over time, relevant for detecting the nature and extent of cognitive changes in elderly, including those with dementia. Fourth, immersive VR has been related to cybersickness. Finally, VR is immersive and enables the perception and expression of emotions, motor behaviors, and multiple senses. Aged subjects are found to have sparing of emotional learning and show increased reliance on multisensory integration for learning. Moreover, they experience high levels of flow, motivation, and presence in VR setups. Despite the clear potential of immersive VR, the studies available are small scale and have not been replicated. The digital illiteracy of elderly and healthcare personnel form an additional barrier for implementation. Hence, while replication of outcomes and standardization of VR interventions is required before it can be used in standard care, VR may provide a particularly effective tool for training cognition in elderly. © 2020 S.

Twenty-one older adults in a senior living community and a family member (who participated in the VR with the older adult from a distance) engaged in a baseline telephone call, followed by three weekly VR sessions. The VR was associated with improvements in older adults? affect and stress, relationship with their family member, and overall quality of life, compared to baseline. Family members? negative affect, depressive symptoms, and caregiver burden also decreased and their mental health improved after using the VR, compared to baseline. Using the VR, however, did not change their relationship with the older adult. In addition, older adults and family members who experienced the VR sessions as more socially engaging reported better psychological and relational well-being, with older adults also experiencing greater improvements in overall quality of life. Finally, preliminary results suggest that older adults with dementia and their family members might benefit even more from using the VR than older adults with MCI and their family members. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Collaboratively designing exercise video games (exergames) as a multistakeholder team is fundamental to creating games that are attractive, effective, and accessible. Objective: This research extensively explores the use of human-centered design methods that involve persons living with dementia in long-term care facilitates, exercise professionals, content developers, game designers, and researchers in the creation of VR exergames targeting physical activity promotion for persons living with dementia/MCI. Methods: Conceptualization, collaborative design, and playtesting activities were carried out to design VR exergames to engage persons living with dementia in exercises to promote upper limb flexibility, strength, and aerobic endurance. We involved a total of 7 persons living with dementia/MCI, 5 exercise professionals, 5 community-dwelling older adults, a VR company for content creation, and a multidisciplinary research team with game designers, engineers, and kinesiology experts. Results: An immersive VR exergame called Seas the Day was jointly designed and developed and it is freely available to be played in state-of-the-art VR headsets (Oculus Quest 1, 2). A model for the triadic interaction (health care institution, industry partner, academia) is also presented to illustrate how different stakeholders contribute to the design of VR exergames that consider/complement complex needs, preferences, and motivators of an underrepresented group of end users. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that a collaborative multistakeholder design results in more tailored and context-aware VR games for persons living with dementia. The insights and lessons learned from this research can be used by others to co-design games, including remote engagement techniques that were used during the COVID-19 pandemic. © John Muñoz, Samira Mehrabi, Yirou Li, Aysha Basharat, Laura E Middleton, Shi Cao, Michael Barnett-Cowan, Jennifer Boger."

This paper presents a systematic review of studies of Socially Assistive Systems targeted at older adults and people with disabilities. The purpose is threefold: (1) Characterizing related assistive systems with a special focus on the system design, primarily including HCI technologies used and user-involvement approach taken; (2) Examining their ways of system evaluation; (3) Reflecting on insights for future design research. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted using the keywords “social interactions” and “assistive technologies” within the following databases: Scopus, Web of Science, ACM, Science Direct, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore. Results Sixty-five papers met the inclusion criteria and were further analyzed. Our results showed that there were 11 types of HCI technologies that supported social interactions for target users. The most common was cognitive and meaning understanding technologies, often applied with wearable devices for compensating users’ sensory loss; 33.85% of studies involved end-users and stakeholders in the design phase; Four types of evaluation methods were identified. The majority of studies adopted laboratory experiments to measure user-system interaction and system validation. Proxy users were used in system evaluation, especially in initial experiments; 42.46% of evaluations were conducted in field settings, primarily including the participants’ own homes and institutions. Conclusion We contribute an overview of Socially Assistive Systems that support social interactions for older adults and people with disabilities, as well as illustrate emerging technologies and research opportunities for future work. © 2021, The Author(s)."
