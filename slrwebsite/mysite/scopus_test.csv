Despite numerous opportunities to develop tourist villages such as the availability of natural resources and high demand for tourist villages recently, some challenges are still faced to develop tourist villages, especially in a developing country such as Indonesia. Governance problems, infrastructure, and effective partnership are among other factors that remain challenging in developing tourist villages. This study attempts to identify factors that determine the state of tourist villages in Indonesia and determine the appropriate strategies for better tourist village development. Using the case of tourist villages in Kedung Ombo, Central Java, a water based attractive tourist village, this study uses both machine learning and multicriteria approaches by means of Promethee in order to address the objective of the study. This study shows that government support, application of information technology, infrastructure, local participation, partnership, and attractive variations, are among the determinant factors that affect tourist village development. The study also reveals that the appropriate strategies for tourist village development include, improving infrastructure, institutional strengthening, and capacity building. This study could be used to assist local national as well as sub-national governments to effectively manage tourist villages in Indonesia. © 2023 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.",Determinant factors; Development strategies; Machine learning; Multicriteria; Promethee; Tourist village,Article,Scopus

For SVM-based fault classification, the data set is formed by analysing the operation of the standard IEC microgrid model, with and without grid interconnection, under different fault and non-fault scenarios. Fault scenarios also include different locations, resistances, and incident angles of fault. Whereas, for non-fault scenarios, the variation in load is considered. Voltages and currents from both ends of the distribution line (DL) are sampled at 1920 Hz. The time and frequency series parameters, total harmonic distortion (THD) in current and voltage, and differential parameters are determined. The SVM algorithm uses these parameters to detect and classify faults. The performance of this developed SVM based algorithm is compared with that of different machine learning algorithms. This comparative analysis reveals that SVM detects and classifies the faults on the microgrid with an accuracy of over 99.99%. The performance of the proposed method is also tested with 30 dB, 35 dB, and 40 dB noise in the generated data, which represent measurement errors. © 2023 University of Mohaghegh Ardabili.

In particular, the main problems that hinder its complete understanding are the absence of a clear definition and a model for its identification, management, and forecasting. Focusing on forecasting technical debt, there is a growing notion that preventing technical debt build-up allows you to identify and address the riskiest debt items for the project before they can permanently compromise it. However, despite this high relevance, the forecast of technical debt is still little explored. To this end, this study aims to evaluate whether the quality metrics of a software system can be useful for the correct prediction of the technical debt. Therefore, the data related to the quality metrics of 8 different open-source software systems were analyzed and supplied as input to multiple machine learning algorithms to perform the prediction of the technical debt. In addition, several partitions of the initial dataset were evaluated to assess whether prediction performance could be improved by performing a data selection. The results obtained show good forecasting performance and the proposed document provides a useful approach to understanding the overall phenomenon of technical debt for practical purposes. © 2023, Higher Education Press.",empirical study; machine learning; software quality metrics; technical debt,Article,Scopus

Five machine learning algorithms were used on the dataset to attain the objectives: support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian process (GP), random forest (RF), random tree (RT), and random tree bagging. The best model for predicting the flexural strength of concrete using waste marble powder after statistical indices were analyzed to assess the performance of the algorithms. Sensitivity analysis has also been carried out in order to identify the variable that is most sensitive. The findings show that adding waste marble powder at a higher concentration—between 5 and 20%—improves the concrete flexural strength. Because the CC value is more than 0.75 for all algorithms, statistical analysis indicates that algorithms, such as SVM, GP, RF, RT, and Random Tree bagging, can be utilized to predict the flexural strength. The GP model outperformed in terms of performance, having a higher CC (0.8108) and lower RMSE (2.6025 MPa) and RRSE (59.32%). Additionally, the GP model's sensitivity analysis revealed that concrete mixes: MP 5 (C0:S100), MP 10 (C100:S0), MP 10 (C50:S50), and MP 15 (C75:S25) are sensitive sequentially due to lower CC values. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Concrete; Flexural strength; Gaussian process; Marble powder; Support vector machine,Article,Scopus

Visual inspection is currently practiced for assessing myopathies in broiler meat, which is however prone to human evaluation error, labor-intensive, and costly. Imaging technology that employs uniform or diffuse illumination has been investigated for assessing broiler meat quality, but their performance is not always satisfactory, especially for detecting subtle defects with few visual symptoms. This study presents the first proof-of-concept evaluation of the utility of an innovative technique for improved imaging of structures of biological materials, i.e., structured-illumination reflectance imaging (SIRI), for detecting WS conditions in broiler breast meat. Broiler breast fillets with varying degrees of WS severity were imaged by an in-house assembled SIRI system under sinusoidal illumination at different spatial frequencies (0.05–0.40 cycles/mm). The acquired pattern images were demodulated into direct components (DC) and amplitude components (AC) at each spatial frequency. Texture features were extracted from DC and AC images for building classification models using regularized linear discriminant analysis, which were to classify the poultry meat samples into 2, 3, and 4 classes, respectively, according to WS conditions. AC images were found by visual inspection more effective than DC in resolving WS characteristics, depending on the spatial frequency of illumination patterns. Compared to DC, AC yielded the maximum accuracy improvements of 8.33%, 7.93%, and 12.3% in 2-, 3- and 4-class classifications, respectively. Classification models using ranked features yielded similar improvements of up to 9.53% by AC over DC. The SIRI technique is promising for enhanced detection of WS and potentially other defects of broiler breast meat. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Grading; Image processing; Machine learning; Myopathy; Poultry; Structured illumination,Article,Scopus

To combat this, we developed and evaluated a novel deep neural network (DNN) and a validation framework to promote transparent cAI development. Methods: Data from Japan's largest ICU database was used to develop the DNN model, predicting in-hospital mortality including ICU and post-ICU mortality by days since ICU discharge. The most important variables to the model were extracted with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to examine the DNN's efficacy as well as develop models that were also externally validated. Main results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for predicting ICU mortality was 0.94 [0.93-0.95], and 0.91 [0.90-0.92] for in-hospital mortality, ranging between 0.91–0.95 throughout one year since ICU discharge. An external validation using only the top 20 variables resulted with higher AUCs than traditional severity scores. Conclusions: Our DNN model consistently generated AUCs between 0.91–0.95 regardless of days since ICU discharge. The 20 most important variables to our DNN, also generated higher AUCs than traditional severity scores regardless of days since ICU discharge. To our knowledge, this is the first study that predicts ICU and in-hospital mortality using cAI by post-ICU discharge days up to over a year. This finding could contribute to increased transparency on cAI applications. © 2022 Société française d'anesthésie et de réanimation (Sfar)",Artificial Intelligence; Clinical decision support; Ethical artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Mortality prediction,Article,Scopus

Secondly, three machine learning approaches are applied, including linear regression (LR), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) in order to predict the springback of sandwich panels in the three-point bending process. The performance of these approaches is investigated by using some statistical tools like mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2).

The cell involves an industrial robot, a custom gripper, pneumatic and electric actuators with the aim of moving and opening the frame hooks, and a custom vision pipeline for detecting the feature of interest during the picking and hooking phases. The implemented pipeline makes use of a stereo camera pair mounted under the robot gripper and two fixed monocular cameras. The method employs HOG feature descriptors and machine learning algorithms for the detection. The software architecture is a component-based designed architecture that uses ROS as the underlying framework and ROS-Industrial packages to control the robot. The robot is controlled with position-based commands to reach intermediate positions in the workspace and with velocity command to implement a visual servoing control scheme that runs at 30 Hz and adjusts the robot position with the feedback of the vision during picking and hooking.

Among them, local-based algorithms, including Local SGD and FedAvg, have gained much attention due to their superior properties, such as low communication cost and privacy-preserving. Nevertheless, when the data distribution on workers is non-identical, local-based algorithms would encounter a significant degradation in the convergence rate. In this paper, we propose Variance Reduced Local SGD (VRL-SGD) to deal with the heterogeneous data. Without extra communication cost, VRL-SGD can reduce the gradient variance among workers caused by the heterogeneous data, and thus it prevents local-based algorithms from slow convergence rate. Moreover, we present VRL-SGD-W with an effective warm-up mechanism for the scenarios, where the data among workers are quite diverse. Benefiting from eliminating the impact of such heterogeneous data, we theoretically prove that VRL-SGD achieves a linear iteration speedup with lower communication complexity even if workers access non-identical datasets. We conduct experiments on three machine learning tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that VRL-SGD performs impressively better than Local SGD for the heterogeneous data and VRL-SGD-W is much robust under high data variance among workers. © 2023, Higher Education Press.",distributed optimization; federated learning; local SGD; non-IID data; variance reduction,Article,Scopus

This paper presents an approach based on statistical indices and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods to interpret frequency responses. The proposed procedure divides frequency responses into four frequency regions based on frequency resonances and antiresonances. Then, Lin’s Concordance Coefficient (LCC) index is used as one of the most appropriate numerical indices to extract features of the four frequency regions. Finally, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network is trained by the extracted features to identify and differentiate the types of winding faults. Besides, other intelligent algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), and Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network have been employed to compare the classification results. The proposed techniques have been practically implemented. The Axial Displacement (AD) and Disk Space Variation (DSV) faults are applied as two common mechanical faults in different locations and intensities on the 20kV windings of a 1.6MVA distribution power transformer and their corresponding frequency responses are calculated. Frequency responses calculated from the AD and DSV faults constitute the MLP input data set. The network is trained with part of the input data, and the rest of the data is allocated to validate and test the network. The results show that the suggested method has more proper performance than others using the phase component of the frequency responses in interpreting frequency responses and separation and identifying various mechanical fault types of transformer windings. © 2023 University of Mohaghegh Ardabili.

For many cities, it is still under debate whether the trend of surface O3 variation is driven by meteorology or the change in precursors emissions. In this work, a time series decomposition method (Seasonal-Trend decomposition procedure based on Loess (STL)) and random forest (RF) algorithm were utilized to quantify the meteorological impacts on the recorded O3 trend and identify the key meteorological factors affecting O3 pollution in Tianjin, the biggest coastal port city in Northern China. After “removing” the meteorological fluctuations from the observed O3 time series, we found that variation of O3 in Tianjin was largely driven by the changes in precursors emissions. The meteorology was unfavorable for O3 pollution in period of 2015-2016, and turned out to be favorable during 2017-2021. Specifically, meteorology contributed 9.3 µg/m3 O3 (13%) in 2019, together with the increase in precursors emissions, making 2019 to be the worst year of O3 pollution since 2015. Since then, the favorable effects of meteorology on O3 pollution tended to be weaker. Temperature was the most important factor affecting O3 level, followed by air humidity in O3 pollution season. In the midday of summer days, O3 pollution frequently exceeded the standard level (&gt;160 µg/m3) at a combined condition with relative humidity in 40%-50% and temperature &gt; 31°C.

There are obvious differences in the techniques of male and female athletes and the key technical indicators of athletes of different sexes have not yet been known. OBJECTIVE: To select key technical indicators that affect the competition performance of elite speed climbing athletes, thereby providing direction and theoretical support for the scientific training of speed climbing. METHODS: The videos of speed climbing finals in the 2017-2021 World Championships, World Cup and China Climbing League were selected to obtain the competition samples of the top four male and female athletes (109 men and 117 women). Reaction time, contact time and segmental speed were collected and then random forest and XGBoost models of male and female speed climbing athletes were established using two-dimensional kinematic analysis. Accordingly, the influence of each technical indicator on the competition performance was calculated. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: For male athletes, the root-mean-square error values of random forest and XGBoost models were 0.224 and 0.265, respectively, and r2 was 0.765 and 0.686, respectively. The key technical indicators were total contact time of the left hand, motion frequency of the right hand, total contact time of the right hand, speed of holds 3-6, motion frequency of the left foot, total contact time of the right foot, speed of holds 11-13, speed of holds 13-18, speed of holds 8-10, total contact time of the left foot, number of total holds of the left hand and motion frequency of the right foot. For female athletes, the root-mean-square error indicator of random forest and XGBoost models were 0.066 and 0.055, respectively, and r2 were 0.846 and 0.887, respectively. The key technical indicators were total contact time of the left hand, total contact time of the right hand, motion frequency of the right hand, motion frequency of the left foot, total contact time of the left foot, speed of holds 8-10, total contact time of the right foot, and speed of holds 10-11 and 13-18. To conclude, the technical indicators of the upper limbs (contact time sum and action frequency) on speed rock climbing competition are more influential than those of the lower limbs. The number of holds has no high influence on the competition results. The key segments for winning in male and female elite athletes are holds 3-6 and 8-11 respectively. Athletes should focus on optimizing the upper limb contact time of the key segments for winning and then optimize the lower limb contact time, so as to improve the competition performance. © 2023, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

However, hysteresis is an intrinsic property of MSMA material, which seriously affects the positioning accuracy of MSMA-BA. In this study, we propose a multi meta-model approach incorporating the nonlinear auto-regressive moving average with exogenous inputs (NARMAX) and Bouc–Wen (BW) models to describe the complex dynamic hysteresis of MSMA-BA. In particular, the BW model is introduced into the NARMAX model as an exogenous variable function, and a wavelet neural network (WNN) is adopted to construct the nonlinear function of the multi meta-model. In addition, iterative learning control is combined with a WNN to improve its convergence speed. A two-valued function is employed in the controller design process, so as to make use of history iteration information in updating control input. The main contribution of this study is the convergence analysis of the proposed iteration learning controller with iteration-dependent uncertainties (non-strict repetition of the initial state and varying iteration length).

The two main architecture approaches for the training process are centrally orchestrated Federated Learning and fully decentralized peer-to-peer learning. In decentralized systems, edge devices, known as agents, collaborate in a peer-to-peer architecture, avoiding the need for a central system to orchestrate the process. Decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) learning techniques are well researched under the assumption of independent and identically distributed (IID) data across the agents. IID data is seldom observed in real-world distributed systems, and the training performance varies significantly with non-IID data. This paper proposes a decentralized learning variant of the P2P gossip averaging method with Batch Normalization (BN) adaptation for P2P architectures. It is well-known that BN layers accelerate the convergence of the non-distributed deep learning models. Recent research confirms that Federated Learning methods benefit from using the BN method with some aggregation alterations. Our work demonstrated BN effectiveness in P2P architectures by mitigating the non-IID data characteristics across decentralized agents. We also introduce a variant of the early stopping technique that, combined with BN layers, acts as a fine-tuning technique for agent models. We validated our approach by conducting numerous simulations of different model-topology-communication combinations and comparing them to other decentralized baseline approaches. The evaluations were conducted on the next word prediction task using user comments from the Reddit and StackOverflow datasets representing comments from two different domains. Simulations showed that our approach, on average, achieves a mean relative top accuracy increase of 16.9% in ring (19.9% for Reddit, 13.9% for StackOverflow) and 29.8% in sparse (32.9% for Reddit, 26.6% for StackOverflow) communication topologies compared to the best baseline approach.

A grid search of 144 models is performed, and many of the models exhibit no significant difference in mean performance within a 95% confidence interval. Notably, we find the best performing models have varied network architecture parameters. The explanations for performance largely agree with the accepted wisdom of the machine learning community, which shows that the method is extracting information of value. We find that diversity between models can be achieved by varying network size. Moreover, homogeneous network sizes generally show positive correlation in predictions, and larger models tend to converge to similar solutions.

This problem has crucial applications in various contexts such as viral marketing or controlling the propagation of virus or rumours in real-world networks. Existing approaches for vital node identification mainly focus on capturing the importance of a node through a mathematical expression which directly relates structural properties of the node to its vitality. Although these heuristic approaches have achieved good performance in practice, they have weak adaptability, and their performance is limited to specific settings and certain dynamics. Inspired by the power of machine learning models for efficiently capturing different types of patterns and relations, we propose a machine learning-based, data driven approach for vital node identification. The main idea is to train the model with a small portion of the graph, say 0.5% of the nodes, and do the prediction on the rest of the nodes. The ground-truth vitality for the train data is computed by simulating the SIR diffusion method starting from the train nodes. We use collective feature engineering where each node in the network is represented by incorporating elements of its connectivity, degree and extended coreness. Several machine learning models are trained on the node representations, but the best results are achieved by a Support Vector Regression machine with RBF kernel. The empirical results confirms that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models on a selection of datasets, while it also shows more adaptability to changes in the dynamics parameters.

We mainly assess whether the writer's attitude towards a specific topic, or a product, is positive, negative, or neutral. Numerous machine learning and fuzzy logic methods have been reconnoitered for sentiment analysis. Yet, the application of mathematical optimization techniques for sentiment tagging is still unexplored. This study presents a novel mathematical framework for sentiment analysis of reviews based on Game Theory. We identify whether the sentiment of a review is positive or negative. In the first step, we comprehend a review and derive context scores from review comments using the SentiWordNet lexicon. We comprehensively combine the computed context and rating scores using the Bayesian Game Model to deduce the sentiment of reviews. Experimental results on three benchmark review datasets, viz. Food, Mobile, and Electronics demonstrate that the proposed model yields state-of-the-art results. We also statistically validated the stability and correctness of the results. The proposed model ensures rational and consistent results.

In this paper, we present a semantic parsing model based on neural networks to obtain semantic representation of a given sentence. We utilise semantic representation of each sentence to generate semantically informed sentence embeddings for extrinsic evaluation of the proposed semantic parser, in particular for the semantic textual similarity task. Our neural parser utilises self-attention mechanism to learn semantic relations between words in a sentence to generate semantic representation of a sentence in UCCA (Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation) semantic annotation framework (Abend and Rappoport, 2013), which is a cross-linguistically applicable graph-based semantic representation. The UCCA representations are conveyed into a Siamese Neural Network built on top of two Recursive Neural Networks (Siamese-RvNN) to derive semantically informed sentence embeddings which are evaluated on semantic textual similarity task. We conduct both single-lingual and cross-lingual experiments with zero-shot and few-shot learning, which have shown superior performance even in low-resource scenario. The experimental results show that the proposed self-attentive neural parser outperforms the other parsers in the literature on English and German, and shows significant improvement in the cross-lingual setting for French which has comparatively low sources. Moreover, the results obtained from other downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis confirm that semantically informed sentence embeddings provide higher-quality embeddings compared to other pre-trained models such as SBERT (Reimers et al., 2019) or SimCSE (Gao et al., 2021), which do not utilise such structured information. © 2022",Recursive Neural Network; Self-attention; Semantic parsing; Semantic textual similarity; Siamese Network; UCCA,Article,Scopus

Outside of clinical trials, neurologic outcomes must typically be extracted by labor intensive manual review of clinical notes in the electronic health record (EHR). To overcome this challenge, we set out to develop a natural language processing (NLP) approach that automatically reads clinical notes to determine neurologic outcomes, to make it possible to conduct larger scale neurologic outcomes studies. We obtained 7314 notes from 3632 patients hospitalized at two large Boston hospitals between January 2012 and June 2020, including discharge summaries (3485), occupational therapy (1472) and physical therapy (2357) notes. Fourteen clinical experts reviewed notes to assign scores on the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) with 4 classes, namely ‘good recovery’, ‘moderate disability’, ‘severe disability’, and ‘death’ and on the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS), with 7 classes, namely ‘no symptoms’, ‘no significant disability’, ‘slight disability’, ‘moderate disability’, ‘moderately severe disability’, ‘severe disability’, and ‘death’. For 428 patients’ notes, 2 experts scored the cases generating interrater reliability estimates for GOS and mRS. After preprocessing and extracting features from the notes, we trained a multiclass logistic regression model using LASSO regularization and 5-fold cross validation for hyperparameter tuning. The model performed well on the test set, achieving a micro average area under the receiver operating characteristic and F-score of 0.94 (95% CI 0.93–0.95) and 0.77 (0.75–0.80) for GOS, and 0.90 (0.89–0.91) and 0.59 (0.57–0.62) for mRS, respectively.

However, due to privacy concerns, it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain the locational data of the consumers. Machine learning (ML) based classification strategies can be used to find the locational information of the consumers based on their historical energy consumption patterns. The ML methods in this paper are applied to the Residential Energy Consumption Survey 2009 dataset. In this dataset, the number of consumers in the urban area is higher than the rural area, thus making the classification problem unbalanced. The unbalanced classification problem has been solved in original and transformed or reduced feature space using Monte Carlo based under-sampling of the majority class datapoints. The hyperparameters for each classification algorithm family is represented as an optimized pipeline, obtained using the genetic programming (GP) optimizer. The classification performance metrics are then obtained for different algorithm families on the original and transformed feature spaces. Performance comparisons have been reported using univariate and bivariate distributions of the classification metrics viz. accuracy, geometric mean score (GMS), F1 score, precision, area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operator characteristics (ROC).

Recently, Deep Learning methods, such as the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are being used in BCI systems in search of a performance improvement. However, the straightforward use of EEG data, without any processing step, may limit the full potential of 2D-kernels in CNNs. In light of this, in this work, we consider for classification with 2D-kernel-based CNNs the problem of encoding EEG data to images as a pre-processing stage, which includes the Gramian Angular Difference and Summation Fields, Markov Transition Fields and Recurrence Plots. Additionally, a comparative analysis using a selection of CNNs is performed.

They show a profound interest in data-driven fault diagnosis methods. The process of forming a steady maintenance system is partially but essentially dependent on the diagnostic model. The development of the model relies on the corresponding machinery's data. However, the data-driven model processes substantial data, resulting in excessive processing time. The processing time includes the time spent to form a diagnosis model and the time for the model to evaluate the machinery condition with quantitative accuracy. This study proposes a method to form a fault diagnosis model and to classify a certain operating condition with specific logic. The proposed method, Feature variable Dimensional Coordination (FDC) is a conceptual logic based on feature engineering and distance evaluation of condition indicators. FDC reduces substantial data needed by coordinating the selection of valid feature variables. Furthermore, distance evaluation of coordinated feature variables provides a quantitative indicator called FDC Number to evaluate its current efficiency. The proposed method was verified with three different datasets. Applying the FDC method resulted in the processing time reduction by up to 61% in one of the cases. Numerous other cases showed an identical tendency regarding time. FDC showed improvement in accuracy of diagnosing defects on equivalent verification cases from 54.8% to 93.7%. In conclusion, FDC enhanced the performance of a condition diagnosis model by maintaining the classification accuracy over approximately 90% in most cases and reducing the need for data, resulting in the processing time reduction. © 2022 The Author(s)",Condition diagnosis; Data mining; Data-driven; Feature engineering; Rotary machine; Vibration data,Article,Scopus

Recent studies point to the association between an inflammatory phenotype and certain clinical symptoms in patients with depression. The objective of our study was to classify major depression disorder patients using supervised learning algorithms or machine learning, based on immunometabolic and oxidative stress biomarkers and lifestyle habits. Methods: Taking into account a series of inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers (C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) and glutathione), metabolic risk markers (blood pressure, waist circumference and glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol levels) and lifestyle habits of the participants (physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption), a study was carried out using machine learning in a sample of 171 participants, 91 patients with depression (71.42% women, mean age = 50.64) and 80 healthy subjects (67.50% women, mean age = 49.12). The algorithm used was the support vector machine, performing cross validation, by which the subdivision of the sample in training (70%) and test (30%) was carried out in order to estimate the precision of the model. The prediction of belonging to the patient group (MDD patients versus control subjects), melancholic type (melancholic versus non-melancholic patients) or resistant depression group (treatment-resistant versus non-treatment-resistant) was based on the importance of each of the immunometabolic and lifestyle variables. Results: With the application of the algorithm, controls versus patients, such as patients with melancholic symptoms versus non-melancholic symptoms, and resistant versus non-resistant symptoms in the test phase were optimally classified. The variables that showed greater importance, according to the results of the area under the ROC curve, for the discrimination between healthy subjects and patients with depression were current alcohol consumption (AUC = 0.62), TNF-? levels (AUC = 0.61), glutathione redox status (AUC = 0.60) and the performance of both moderate (AUC = 0.59) and vigorous physical exercise (AUC = 0.58). On the other hand, the most important variables for classifying melancholic patients in relation to lifestyle habits were past (AUC = 0.65) and current (AUC = 0.60) tobacco habit, as well as walking routinely (AUC = 0.59) and in relation to immunometabolic markers were the levels of CRP (AUC = 0.62) and glucose (AUC = 0.58). In the analysis of the importance of the variables for the classification of treatment-resistant patients versus non-resistant patients, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) variable was shown to be the most relevant (AUC = 0.67).

In this case, sex (AUC = 0.59) was also relevant along with alcohol (AUC = 0.58) and tobacco (AUC = 0.56) consumption. Conclusions: The results obtained in our study show that it is possible to predict the diagnosis of depression and its clinical typology from immunometabolic markers and lifestyle habits, using machine learning techniques.

Methods: This study retrospectively recruited 621 CKD patients and 625 healthy controls in Jinling hospital and 57 CKD patients in Hainan hospital. These CKD patients were divided into cognitive function impairment (CFI) group and non-CFI group based on diagnostic criteria. All patients underwent brain MRI scan, neuropsychological test and laboratory exam. A deep learning model (Attention MLP) based on structural and functional sub-network (determined by the comparison between the patients and healthy controls) topological properties was developed to generate the MRI signature for the discrimination of CFI. Finally, a clinical-topological logistic regression model was built by combining MRI signature and clinical features. The area under curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity were calculated to evaluate the model performance. Delong test was used to examine the difference of AUCs between models. The integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and net reclassification index (NRI) between models were calculated. Results: Attention MLP model performed well in both internal test set and external test set (AUC = 0.744 and 0.763, respectively). After combining with the clinical features, the model performance was further improved both in the internal (AUC: 0.748) and external test sets (AUC: 0.774), while both IDI and NRI were significant (all p < 0.05) in the external test set. According to the comprehensive comparison, the AUC of the Attention MLP model was significantly or marginal significantly higher than that of traditional machine learning models (logistic regression: AUC = 0.634; support vector machine: AUC = 0.613; decision tree: AUC = 0.539; XGBoost: AUC = 0.639) in internal test set. The results showed that the model built on the combining of structural and functional networks data outperformed those on the single network, as well as the connection matrix. Conclusion: The result indicated that the integration of the clinical information and the MRI signature generated by artificial intelligence model based on structural and functional network topological properties could help to predict the CFI of CKD patients effectively. Our results provided a set of quantifiable imaging biomarkers for CFI which may be beneficial to CKD patients. © 2022",Brain network; Chronic kidney disease; Cognitive impairment; Deep learning; Graph theory; Machine learning,Article,Scopus

Its instrumental diagnosis is performed by invasive and expensive methods. The surface electromyography (sEMG) emerges as an alternative for automated and objective evaluations of dysphagia symptoms. In this paper we consider thirty-one healthy and 29 dysphagic patients who performed swallowing tasks with water, yogurt, saliva and crackers. The sEMG activity was recorded using bilateral channels for masseter, suprahyoid and infrahyoid muscle groups. Two main analyses were performed. Features in time, frequency, time-frequency, and nonlinear dynamics domains were analyzed to find biomarkers suitable to model dysphagia. Additionally, the automatic discrimination of dysphagia was evaluated with three classification scenarios using: (1) individual features, (2) individual muscle groups, and (3) the combination of muscle groups. Time-features domain exhibited a well-defined representation pattern of swallowing, and achieved the highest individual classification performance (AUC>0.8). The two scenarios with muscle groups yielded the best results along the experiments (AUC>0.85). The best classification results are found with the suprahyoid and masseter muscles, in water and saliva intake. As the main result of the study, we proposed a set of sEMG related biomarkers and classification approaches suitable for automatic dysphagia screening, a step forward in the implementation of non-invasive and objective strategies for swallowing evaluation. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Dysphagia; Feature selection; Machine learning; sEMG; Signal processing,Article,Scopus

Most UFS methods map features into a pseudo label space by multiplying a projection matrix constrained with sparsity to learn the mapping from the features to the labels. However, the mapping relationship is usually not linear, and linear regression may result in a suboptimal selection. To address this issue, we propose a novel UFS method, called neural networks embedded self-expression (NNSE). NNSE replaces the linear regression of traditional spectral analysis methods with neural networks to learn the pseudo label space. Besides, we embed neural networks into the self-expression model to improve the representative ability by preserving the local structure with an adaptive graph regularization module. Then we propose an efficient alternative iterative algorithm to solve the proposed model. Experimental results on 8 public datasets show NNSE outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods.

We sought to utilize a supervised machine learning method to determine combinations of factors with the greatest influence on long-term survival in older EGS patients. Methods: We identified community dwelling participants admitted for EGS conditions from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey linked with claims (1992-2013). We categorized three binary domains of multimorbidity: chronic conditions, functional limitations, and geriatric syndromes (such as vision or hearing impairment, falls, incontinence). We also collected EGS disease type, age, and sex. We created a classification and regression tree (CART) model to identify groups of variables associated with our outcome of interest, three-year survival. We then performed Cox proportional hazards analysis to determine hazard ratios for each group with the lowest risk group as reference. Results: We identified 1960 patients (median age 79 [interquartile range [IQR]: 73, 85], 59.5% female). The CART model identified the presence of functional limitations as the primary splitting variable. The lowest risk group were patient aged ?81 y with biliopancreatic disease and without functional limitations. The highest risk group was men aged ?75 y with functional limitations (hazard ratio [HR] 11.09 (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.91-20.83)). Notably absent from the CART model were chronic conditions and geriatric syndromes. Conclusions: More than the presence of chronic conditions or geriatric syndromes, functional limitations are an important predictor of long-term survival and must be included in presurgical assessment. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Emergency general surgery; Frailty; Functional status; Geriatric surgery; Multimorbidity,Article,Scopus

In this work, a novel C36 fullerene 2D network with an isotropic structure is designed by screening of extensive and diverse fullerene lattices. Density functional theory calculations confirm that the herein predicted C36 fullerene network can exhibit an outstanding thermal stability up to 1500 K, an elastic modulus of 266 GPa, a negative Poisson's ratio of ?0.05, and an indirect semiconducting electronic nature, with a HSE06(PBE) bad gap of 1.63 (0.97) eV.

MLIP-based calculations close to the ground state confirm the dynamical stability, a negative Poisson's ratio of ?0.06, an elastic modulus of 269 GPa, and a high tensile strength of around 26.8 GPa for the predicted 2D network.

This paper proposes an opportunistic capacity based resource allocation method for network slicing contained 6G wireless communication networks with uncertain shared spectrum. In particular, a 4D conflict graph model to describe the conflict relationship in the process of resource allocation for network slicing is constructed under scenarios of 6G wireless systems. Then, a novel Hasse traversal algorithm is proposed to achieve conflict free node set. To improve the spectrum utilization of shared spectrum, we present a novel statistical spectrum sharing model for shared channel to describe the uncertainty and derive the opportunistic capacity of shared channel.

Statistical inference estimates the probabilities of uncertainty from a sample drawn from a population. Assessing the statistical significance of accuracies reported by DL remains largely unexplored. A framework to do so would usefully support a range of applications, and in particular group classifications from neuroimages where, for operational reasons, sample sizes are necessary limited and thus often do not generalise well. We applied a random-effects inference based on a label permutation test to calculate the statistical significance of K-fold cross-validation (CV) from statistical power and Type-I error rates. Our hypothesis is that in low sample size scenarios, the use of resubstitution with upper bound correction (RUB) as a validation would mitigate the debate on the generalisation ability of DL models. The derived framework enables testing such generalisation ability of DL models as feature extraction methods. A combination of autoencoders and support vector machines as feature extraction and classification models is evaluated in a case-control analysis of Alzheimer's disease with well-established outcomes. We found that RUB slightly outperforms K-fold CV as a validation method, especially estimating statistical power in the most heterogeneous samples. Therefore, we suggest RUB as potent and valid method for DL with neuroimages in terms of bias, variance and computational demand. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Alzheimer's disease; Deep Learning; Family wise error; Neuroimaging; Statistical power; Statistical significance,Article,Scopus

The banks need the probability of default to calculate the expected loss and the unexpected loss and then determine whether their capital is adequate. Generally speaking, the proposed model can utilize n classifiers and m performance metrics, the larger n, and m, the more diverse and more reliable the model is as an estimate of customer classes. We evaluated the proposed model using five common classifiers, namely k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), AdaBoost, and probabilistic neural network (PNN), and eight performance metrics. To extract the feature, an optimization approach using genetic algorithms and nine different scenarios were used. We have then calculated the optimal parameters of each algorithm simultaneously by defining the cost-sensitive objective function based on the probability of correctly classifying it into two classes 0 (good) and 1 (bad). We evaluated the performance of the proposed hybrid model using the Iranian dataset and the UCI German and Australian datasets. The results indicate the proposed method provides very good scoring performance. Using this approach, the bank can filter its bad customers based on the tolerance it considers for the probability value, so it can decide whether it should provide loans to that customer. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Credit scoring; Genetic algorithm; Hybrid performance metric; Machine learning; Optimization,Article,Scopus

We address this issue by employing an artificial neural network that is trained with data obtained from the material model, more precisely speaking, from different solutions of the direct problem for homogeneous states of deformation. As a result, a solution of the inverse problem of parameter identification can be approximated with the help of a neural network processing experimental data. This approximate solution is used as a starting value for a subsequent, classic optimisation-based parameter identification approach. One key advantage of this strategy is that a network only has to be trained once per material model and can subsequently be applied for different materials. A rather sophisticated material model, incorporating gradient-enhanced damage coupled to plasticity in a geometrically non-linear setting, is used to demonstrate the capabilities of this approach. Two different strategies for the generation of training data are investigated and compared, and the neural network's hyperparameters are optimised for improved prediction capabilities. In view of the calibration of material parameters related to the non-locality of the model, the obtained set of parameters is again considered as a starting value for a final optimisation step, where we consider inhomogeneous states of deformation and digital image correlation data. © 2022 The Author(s)",Digital image correlation; Finite elements; Gradient-enhanced material models; Neural networks; Parameter identification,Article,Scopus

Finding compounds with good bioactivity, metabolic dynamics and safety, including Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Toxicity (ADMET for short), is a long and challenging task in breast cancer therapy. In the paper, molecular descriptor data of compounds was analyzed by the ensemble learning algorithm, and important features were selected for the development and validation of ADMET classification models. The overall process includes data cleaning, data splitting to training and testing sets, feature selection and classification model evaluation. A Two-Level Stacking Algorithm (TLSA) based on ensemble learning is proposed for ADMET classification. Various performance measures like classification accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix, F1-score, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and the Area Under the ROC Curves (AUC) are reported to show the superiority of the proposed method as compared to different classifiers. The experimental results show that the second level algorithm for TLSA utilizes Logistic Regression is better than other classifiers for the properties of Absorption, Distribution and Excretion, with accuracy of 94.6037%, 94.9410% and 88.1956% respectively. For the properties Metabolism and Toxicity, the second level algorithm utilizes Support Vector Machine to achieve the best classification performance, with accuracy of 88.8702% and 96.7960% respectively. The results show that the proposed approach works well with the classification of compound properties and can be a good alternative for the well-known machine learning program. © 2022",Classification; Drug screening; Ensemble learning; Feature selection; Molecular descriptor,Article,Scopus

Analytical tools are capable of detection of specific additions, but in most published cases these tools and associated mathematical models are suitable for only one or a few predetermined adulterants. There is a need for methodology that can detect any addition without having to know the type of adulterant a priori. We analysed a dataset of 200 authentic black pepper samples and a total of 210 adulterated samples consisting of mixtures of black pepper and oil-dress pepper, spent pepper, coffee husk, coffee skin and papaya seeds, respectively. A small, non-destructive spectral tool, a visible-near infrared spectrophotometer, (VIS/NIR) and a slower and more expensive mass spectrometric tool, direct analysis in real time-mass spectrometer (DART-MS), were evaluated according to their performances in terms of adulteration detection for a number of machine learning modes. The often-used approach where an ‘optimal’ model is selected and employed yielded for VIS/NIR very reasonable results for most of the adulterants used, but no single model performed well for all adulterants in the dataset. However, high-level fusion modelling of both one- and two-class models developed for different adulterant types using a penalized excess scoring system led to a performance of typically >75% correct classification, regardless of the nature of the adulterant. DART-MS outperformed VIS/NIR but also led to no single model that was able to detect all adulterants present. From the small number of tested fusion strategies, again the penalized excess score outperformed the other fusion options and yielded perfect classification scores for all but one of the adulterants tested. This shows that this type of modelling for cases where the nature of a target is unknown is a promising approach. It is even speculated that this modelling approach is likely to be suitable for types of adulterant that were not used in the model development phase. © 2022 The Authors",Classification; Direct analysis in real time-mass spectrometry; Fraud; High-level data fusion; Visible-near infrared spectrophotometry,Article,Scopus

However, the measurement of wave by buoys is often interrupted for various reasons. In this paper, five machine learning methods were employed to fill in the missing significant wave height (Hs) data: random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), gated recurrent unit (GRU) and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU). Inputs to the model are the relevant meteorological data from one or more buoys in the vicinity of the target buoy. Then, this study adopted a data assimilation method, Cressman analysis (CA), to correct the outputs of the models. The performances of the five models before and after correction (RF-CA, SVM-CA, ANN-CA, GRU-CA, BiGRU-CA) were compared horizontally and vertically. The statistical results for the test period showed that BiGRU significantly outperforms the other four models, with lower RMSE and scatter index, and higher correlation coefficients. By CA, the errors of the five models were reduced to different degrees, and BiGRU has the most reduction. Multiple tests showed that the performance of BiGRU-CA was more stable than that of RF-CA, SVM-CA, ANN-CA and GRU-CA, and its estimation of storm waves was also accurate and reliable. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Bidirectional gated recurrent unit; Cressman analysis; Missing data; Significant wave height,Article,Scopus

Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) have been typically used as robust COVID-19 positive case detectors in these approaches. Such DCCNs tend to utilize Gradient Descent-Based (GDB) algorithms as the last fully-connected layers’ trainers. Although GDB training algorithms have simple structures and fast convergence rates for cases with large training samples, they suffer from the manual tuning of numerous parameters, getting stuck in local minima, large training samples set requirements, and inherently sequential procedures. It is exceedingly challenging to parallelize them with Graphics Processing Units (GPU). Consequently, the Chimp Optimization Algorithm (ChOA) is presented for training the DCNN's fully connected layers in light of the scarcity of a big COVID-19 training dataset and for the purpose of developing a fast COVID-19 detector with the capability of parallel implementation. In addition, two publicly accessible datasets termed COVID-Xray-5 k and COVIDetectioNet are used to benchmark the proposed detector known as DCCN-Chimp. In order to make a fair comparison, two structures are proposed: i-6c-2 s-12c-2 s and i-8c-2 s-16c-2 s, all of which have had their hyperparameters fine-tuned. The outcomes are evaluated in comparison to standard DCNN, Hybrid DCNN plus Genetic Algorithm (DCNN-GA), and Matched Subspace classifier with Adaptive Dictionaries (MSAD). Due to the large variation in results, we employ a weighted average of the ensemble of ten trained DCNN-ChOA, with the validation accuracy of the weights being used to determine the final weights. The validation accuracy for the mixed ensemble DCNN-ChOA is 99.11%. LeNet-5 DCNN's ensemble detection accuracy on COVID-19 is 84.58%. Comparatively, the suggested DCNN-ChOA yields over 99.11% accurate detection with a false alarm rate of less than 0.89%. The outcomes show that the DCCN-Chimp can deliver noticeably superior results than the comparable detectors. The Class Activation Map (CAM) is another tool used in this study to identify probable COVID-19-infected areas.

With the up-gradation of traditional vehicle ad-hoc networks (VANETs) to the internet of vehicles (IoV), the connectivity is incremental between the vehicular network and the outside world, making cyber-security become a stringent problem. Although existing machine learning-based methods for automotive intrusion detection are powerful, there are still limitations in detection performance and resistance attack types during the unsupervised learning process that lacks massive amounts of labels. Therefore, this paper proposes an in-vehicle intrusion detection system that incorporates a combination of sparse regularization convolutional auto-encoder (SRCAE) and streams clustering to construct a deep evolving stream clustering model, namely DESC-IDS. Specifically, the method encodes continuous messages as 2-D data frames, which are fed into the SRCAE built by the temporal convolutional network (TCN) to obtain a low-dimensional non-linear spatial–temporal mapping of the high-dimensional data. Thereafter, the stream clustering model can describe a contour baseline of normal communication messages by the spatial–temporal features. Based on this baseline, DESC-IDS can detect any abnormal changes in vehicular communication. In particular, this paper exploits the SRCAE to reconstruct message matrices, which are considered as variants of known attacks due to reconstruction deviation. The extensive evaluation results illustrate that the proposed model provides enough performance and real-time competitiveness in anomaly detection, with 96.44% accuracy on the HCRL intrusion dataset and 98.80% accuracy on the ORNL intrusion dataset. For the mixed attack of fabrication and masquerade, the proposed model achieves stable F1-scores of 93.48% and 86.99%, respectively. Moreover, the performance in unknown attacks is righteous with 98.43% accuracy and 97.15% F1-scores. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Anomaly detection; Control area network; Convolutional auto-encoder (CAE); DenStream; In-vehicle network; Unsupervised learning,Article,Scopus

To meet performance requirements, predictive maintenance systems require specialized compute units (i.e., accelerators) in addition to conventional processor cores. Unfortunately, size and cost constraints commonly result in developers being forced into selecting System-on-Chip (SoC) platforms that do not have sufficient resources to fully accelerate all performance-critical functions — in essence raising the challenging question of how to optimally distribute the available resources across accelerators. This work introduces the Resource-Constrained Accelerator Selection (RCS) methodology, which identifies near-optimal multi-accelerator configurations for predictive maintenance applications. RCS takes a library of resource-scalable accelerator architectures as input and then selects the combination of accelerator configurations that minimizes end-to-end latency. We find that enabling RCS for typical predictive maintenance applications requires a resource-scalable Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) accelerator and propose ScaleFFT to fill this gap. We apply RCS and ScaleFFT to a collection of edge computing applications with different sensor bandwidths and find that they reduce end-to-end latency by 2.4× on average for a 256K-point FFT compared to a state-of-the-art configuration that only accelerates the machine learning algorithm. Moreover, we demonstrate that RCS enables real-world gains in oil well and train track monitoring systems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Accelerator; Edge computing; FFT; FPGA; Machine learning; Predictive maintenance,Article,Scopus

Avoiding transferring knowledge from these samples is crucial. Existing researches are limited in this area. To this end, we propose a new unsupervised domain adaptation approach named the prototype-guided feature learning. The proposed method contains three main innovations. Firstly, we propose to utilize the more representative source-domain samples, class prototypes, to learn a domain-invariant subspace with the target samples. Secondly, the modified nearest class prototype method is proposed to predict the target samples by exploiting the structural information of the target domain efficiently. Thirdly, a multi-stage label filtering method is proposed to alleviate the mislabeling problem during training.

Following a within-subjects design, the students applied the three modalities, in a different order, with three different activities. An analysis of the resulting 1195 observations using ML techniques shows how the Random Forest algorithm yields significantly better predictions for three out of the four adoption variables included in the study. Additionally, the application of a set of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques shows that Agreeableness is the best predictor of Usefulness and Ease of Use, while Extraversion is the best predictor of Compatibility, and Neuroticism has the greatest impact on global Intention to Use. The discussion highlights how, as it happens with other innovations in educational processes, low levels of Consciousness is the most consistent predictor of resistance to the introduction of peer assessment processes in the classroom. Also, it stresses the value of peer assessment to augment the positive feelings of students scoring high on Neuroticism, which could lead to better performance.

In this paper, the hybrid intelligent framework is proposed as an integrated prediction tool with high accuracy for signal pre-processing, data prediction, and result optimization of short-term hourly wind speed. Specifically, its excellent performance is guaranteed through adequate information extraction on three stages. The first stage is completed in the signal pre-processing module that the interference information is cleaned up from the hourly wind speed signal via de-noising. The second stage is conducted in the data prediction module that the hidden regular information is fully extracted via the decomposition method. The third stage is performed in the resulting optimization module that the residual information is recovered via error modification. For illustration, the performance of the proposed framework is evaluated through historical hourly wind speed, taken from publicly available Sotavento wind farms. The obtained experimental results indicate that de-noising is beneficial to capturing the real trend, but it may negatively impact short-term prediction accuracy. For the hybrid prediction model based on the empirical mode decomposition-based method, the de-noising mode integrating into the decomposition process is more effective than independent de-noising. The second stage is the key to improving the forecasting performance that, adopting the decomposition method, the average fitting performance is improved by 52.84% than the single models. Before the third stage, chaos test is necessary to determine whether there is a requirement of error modification. In summary, the proposed prediction framework can capture the complex characteristics for different short-term hourly wind speed time series, achieving greater performance than the other comparative models. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Chaos; Hourly wind speed; Hybrid prediction; Machine learning; Short-term,Article,Scopus

A machine learning model trained in a stationary environment where training data does not change, often fails to retain its performance in real world environment. This is because dynamism in data makes the hyper-parametric values of the underlying classifier shift in the search space. For making such a model work for intrusion detection in non-stationary environment, one must have to run hyper-parametric optimization algorithm again and again at various time instances. But the expansion of the existing data in non-stationary environment, makes such a way of tunning the hyper-parameters computationally expensive. So, there is a requirement of more adaptive and computationally efficient optimization frameworks for hyper-parameters to build IDS in non-stationary environment. This paperwork proposes a novel framework to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for intrusion detection by optimizing its hyper-parameters C and ? dynamically. For designing this framework, we have used Moth-Flame Optimization (MFO) as the base optimization algorithm which can be run with random initialization. Further, for utilizing the knowledge generated by running the base optimization algorithm, we have introduced two algorithms- a Lightweight MFO and a simple Knowledge-Based Search. The Lightweight MFO uses the knowledge for initializing the starting solutions and the Knowledge-Based Search uses the knowledge as search space. Based on the result of a drift detection module, the proposed framework identifies the most appropriate algorithm to be used at a particular time instance when re-training of the model is required due to the change in the data. Results have shown a significant reduction in the average time complexity of the hyper-parametric optimization process.

However, the traditional ELMs are typically based on the regular Euclidean data, thus ignoring the intrinsic structured information among data and resulting in poor robustness. In this paper, we present a novel semi-supervised learning framework, termed Graph Convolutional Extreme Learning Machines (GCELM), based on extending the traditional ELM to the non-Euclidean domain. Technically, we recast ELM layers into a randomized graph convolutional embedding layer followed by a graph convolutional regression layer, which endows ELM with the capability to handle graphs in the non-Euclidean domain. Benefiting from the diversity of the randomized graph convolution, we further propose an enhanced GCELM, i.e., Voting-based GCELM (V-GCELM), by using a simple voting ensemble strategy. The proposed methods preserve the advantages of ELMs, thus being more efficient than the gradient-based graph convolutional networks but without loss of graph learning ability. Extensive experiments on 36 benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly outperform many previous semi-supervised classification methods. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Ensemble learning; Extreme learning machine; Graph convolutional network; Semi-supervised classification,Article,Scopus

The battery storage and the main power grid connection are used to facilitate the matching between the demand and production. To control energy flows optimally, an accurate day-ahead prediction of the photovoltaic (PV) panels output is required. However, this is a challenging task due to the fluctuating nature of solar radiation availability. The accuracy of the prediction is influenced by the modelling method and input parameters. In this study, the measured power and weather data is gathered from an experimental installation of PV panels to predict PV output for a 24-hours horizon in 15 min intervals. The multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods are considered in the prediction modelling and compared using performance indicators. The micro-inverter technology is used to gather the individual PV panel output in addition to the overall system output. The results show that the modelling methods have different accuracy performances and the ANN model built with the individual PV output data results in the highest accuracy.

In this study, the Twin Delay Deep Deterministic (TD3) policy gradient method, which is an effective actor-critic RL strategy, is implemented to learn optimal Proportional Integral (PI) controller dynamics from a Direct Current (DC) motor speed control simulation environment. For this purpose, the PI controller dynamics are introduced to the actor-network by using the PI-based observer states from the control simulation environment. A suitable Simulink simulation environment is adapted to perform the training process of the TD3 algorithm. The actor-network learns the optimal PI controller dynamics by using the reward mechanism that implements the minimization of the optimal control objective function. A setpoint filter is used to describe the desired setpoint response, and step disturbance signals with random amplitude are incorporated in the simulation environment to improve disturbance rejection control skills with the help of experience based learning in the designed control simulation environment. When the training task is completed, the optimal PI controller coefficients are obtained from the weight coefficients of the actor-network. The performance of the optimal PI dynamics, which were learned by using the TD3 algorithm and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm, are compared. Moreover, control performance improvement of this RL based PI controller tuning method (RL-PI) is demonstrated relative to performances of both integer and fractional order PI controllers that were tuned by using several popular metaheuristic optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, Grey Wolf Optimization and Differential Evolution. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",DC motor; Deep reinforcement learning; Metaheuristic optimization; PI controller; Twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient,Article,Scopus

The present article deals with the development of a framework to fit classification models based on supervised machine learning techniques to select improvement heuristics for the rectangular 2D strip packing problem (2D-SPP) with 90-degrees rotation. Classification models were fitted to predict the best improvement heuristic for constructive heuristics bottom-left, bottom-left-fill, best-fit, best-fit with bottom-left-fill, fast-heuristic, and fast-heuristic with bottom-left-fill, using 19 features provided by problem characteristics. A total of 15,666 benchmark problem instances from the literature were used to represent the rectangular 2D-SPP characteristics variations found in real-world applications to train and test the fitted classification models.

Prior attempts to integrate random testing with systematic testing lack targeted guidance. In this paper, we propose a guided hybrid testing approach, named Baton, to synergize random testing with concolic testing. It integrates the knowledge inside test cases and their executions into a conditional execution graph, and uses such knowledge to guide test case generation. Specifically, we learn classification models for some conditionals in the conditional execution graph in a demand-driven way. These models are used to guide random testing to reach and cover partially-covered conditionals. We further employ targeted concolic testing to cover conditionals that cannot be fully covered by guided random testing. We implemented Baton for Java and evaluated it on three benchmarks.

These difficulties made us motivated to propose an advanced and high accurate framework based on the concepts of deep learning and evolutionary algorithms to automatically design the ResNet architecture efficiently for classifying three types of brain tumors on a large database of MRI images. Thus, we propose an optimization-based deep convolutional ResNet model combined with a novel evolutionary algorithm to optimize the architecture and hyperparameters of deep ResNet model automatically without need of human experts as well manual architecture design which is complicated task to classify different types of brain tumor. Also, we propose an improved version of ant colony optimization (IACO) based on the concepts of differential evolution strategy and multi-population operators. These two concepts make an effective balance for solution diversity and convergence speed as well as enhancing the optimization performance and avoiding falling into the local optima for designing the deep learning-based ResNet architectures.

Combining principal component analysis and orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis, 11 differential compounds for NFC and FC orange juices discrimination were identified. Among them, limonin and hydroxymethylfurfural were higher in FC than in NFC samples, whereas the remaining nine compounds showed the opposite trend. During processing, concentration was the key step for the formation of the differential compounds. Therefore, these 11 compounds have great potential for discrimination between NFC and thermal concentrated FC orange juice processed by other sterilization methods. Based on these 11 differential compounds, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and partial least squares discriminant analysis machine models were used to identify NFC and FC orange juices. The SVM model was the most accurate model to discriminate between NFC and FC orange juices, with 100% accuracy for both the training and validation sets. Subsequently, the SVM model was used for commercial sample identification, and one NFC orange juice was mislabeled. Our results demonstrated that untargeted screening coupled with machine learning could be a powerful tool for the discrimination of NFC and FC juice. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Authenticity; High hydrostatic pressure; Machine learning; Metabolomics; UPLC-QTOF-MS,Article,Scopus

Although traditionally it has a strong focus on natural language, images can potentially provide an additional source of information in machine translation. However, there are presently two challenges: (i) the lack of an effective fusion method to handle the triangular-mapping function between image, text, and semantic knowledge; and (ii) the accessibility of large-scale parallel corpus to train a model for generating accurate machine translations. To address these challenges, this work proposes an effective multimodality information fusion method for automated machine translation based on semi-supervised learning. The method fuses multimodality information, texts and images to deliver automated machine translation. Specifically, our objective fuses multimodalities with alignment in a multimodal attention network, which advances the method through the power of mapping text and image features to their semantic information with accuracy. Moreover, a semi-supervised learning method is utilized for its capability in using a small number of parallel corpus for supervised training on the basis of unsupervised training.

This data-based simulation approach can address biased results of hybrid simulation of structures that contain multiple critical components while improving the efficiency of the seismic hybrid simulation. The digital twin is trained in two phases: (1) passive (initial) training phase using past experimental test data before the hybrid simulation starts, and (2) recursive model updating phase using the active (real-time) data produced by the physical specimen during hybrid simulation. The passive training is achieved using the Prandtl–Ishlinskii (PI) hysteresis model combined with the sparse identification technique, while the recursive least-squares algorithm is used in the second phase as the model updating scheme. In particular, the sparse identification technique facilitates the selection of the optimal number of hysteretic model parameters in the passive training phase, which are then tuned in the model updating phase. The architecture of the proposed DMHS framework is first presented, followed by digital twin training steps. The application of the proposed DMHS is then demonstrated, and its simulation accuracy is assessed through virtual hybrid simulation of a two-storey steel buckling-restrained braced frame, which consists of a digital twin (second-storey brace) and a virtual experimental specimen (first-storey brace) integrated into the numerical model of the structure that is subjected to a set of earthquake ground motion accelerations. The results obtained from the verification study serve to validate the proposed architecture of the DMHS framework and evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of this technique in simulating the nonlinear seismic response of structural systems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Digital twin; Machine learning; Model updating; Seismic hybrid simulation; Structural response evaluation,Article,Scopus

A precise SOC estimation can effectively protect the battery and extend its service life. Recently, a leading-edge machine learning model, namely the extreme learning machine (ELM), has been applied for SOC estimation due to its powerful fitting and fast training capabilities. However, as BMS is required to operate in more and more complex environments, it is inevitable to encounter the effects of non-Gaussian noises caused by system errors, human causes, and other factors. These noises are random, sparse, and far from the targets, mainly referring to the outliers. The classical extreme learning machine (ELM) is susceptible to noise, leading to poor performance in outlier-contaminated datasets. To overcome this problem, we developed a new robust SOC estimation method through the outlier robust ELM (OR-ELM) in this paper. Additionally, a powerful iterative algorithm, namely the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), was utilized for training OR-ELM. Experiments were carried out on a dataset of Panasonic 18650 cells, and the results show the applicability and robustness of OR-ELM in the SOC estimation. © 2022 The Author(s)",Alternating direction method of multipliers; Battery management system; Extreme learning machine; Robustness; State of charge,Article,Scopus

In Europe, let alone it is estimated that 20% of all citizens suffer from one form of CVD, namely cerebrovascular disease or heart failure and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Among the latter, Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is of particular importance since it is deadly and, hence, requires a prompt diagnosis and immediate medical attention. Aiming to deal with prognostication and promote consistency in managing patients with ACS, the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk score has been proposed. This tool is based on eight independent risk factors roughly accounting for 89.9% of prognostic information. Nevertheless, as some other risk factors, not included in GRACE, are also known to be important vectors in the stratification of patients, namely haemoglobin at admission, it is expected that by embedding additional risk factors information into GRACE it will lead to a better characterisation of a patient's risk. Making use of data-fusion techniques, the present work proposes a generalisable framework to improve the classification performance of GRACE in predicting the risk of death in the course of six months after an ACS event, while preserving its interpretability and applicability. Considering haemoglobin concentration at admission, as an additional risk factor, it is shown that the discrimination performance of new GRACE Plus score outperformed that of GRACE in a database of cohorts comprising 1506 patients admitted with ACS, showing a F-1 score of 0.6033 for GRACE Plus against 0.5828 for GRACE, which is corroborated by one-tailed t-test in terms of correct stratification of death and survival endpoints, namely, t=?9.1876 and p<0.001. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Acute Coronary Syndrome; Correction factor; Data fusion; GRACE risk score; Machine learning,Article,Scopus

The most important task in adopting OpenMP is deciding the parallel pattern with associated clauses to employ in a sequential program that already exists. The shared-memory parallelization is complicated by parallel directives with different roles. Some tools have been developed to assist programmers in developing parallel programs using OpenMP. Many tools, however, have constraints on the size of program analysis, OpenMP scoping, and scalar and array reduction. Manually selecting clauses with the necessary data-sharing attributes is also prone to errors. In this study, we target the variable classification in directives to explore the loop-level parallelism. We set the variable classification problem as a type inference task based on a machine learning method, which understands the attributes of variables in certain contexts and relations. We propose an aligned corpus of tokens and types to predict variable attributes used inside the target loop. We support the reduction clause whenever it is applicable.

To smooth these issues, and motivated by the current Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, in this paper, we propose a learning-based system and a hidden Markov model (i) to assess hazardous places of a contagious disease, and (ii) to predict the probability of individuals’ infection. To this end, we track the trajectories of individuals in an environment. For evaluating the models and the approaches, we use the Covid-19 outbreak in an urban environment as a case study. Individuals in a closed population are explicitly represented by their movement trajectories over a period of time. The simulation results demonstrate that by adjusting the communicable disease parameters, the detector system and the predictor system are able to correctly assess the hazardous places and determine the infection possibility of individuals and cluster them accurately with high probability, i.e., on average more than 96%. In general, the proposed approaches to assessing hazardous places and predicting the infection possibility of individuals can be applied to contagious diseases by tailoring them to the influential features of the disease. © 2022",Covid-19; Hidden Markov model; Machine learning; Patient prediction; Trajectory clustering; Trajectory tracking,Article,Scopus

Most of the practical applications related to this kind of classification problem exhibit class imbalance in the available data, thus including an additional difficulty to the classification task. This problem has high practical importance because it appears intrinsically in relevant application fields, such as Finance or Health. We propose to use a 2-step Bayesian methodology to solve this problem because its formulation allows the inclusion of the individual example costs in the classification and takes into account the class probabilities.

Unlike some similar approaches in the literature that use heuristic methods in the first step, which in most cases require calibration mechanisms to compensate for the estimation biases, the consistency of the proposed estimates is theoretically supported, thus providing a clear potential advantage. Experiments with seven real-world datasets show that the proposed methods are competitive against eleven state-of-the-art benchmarks, and provide an advantage in the less favourable situations: cases with a strong imbalance and highly nonlinear classification borders. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Bregman divergences; Classification; Example-dependent cost; Imbalanced data; Neural networks,Article,Scopus

In this study, the use of multi-label classification techniques is proposed to simultaneously predict pipe failures in water supply systems for multiple years.

The main objective of this systematic literature review is to provide a comprehensive overview of automated clinical coding systems that utilise appropriate NLP, machine learning and deep learning methods and techniques to assign the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes to discharge summaries. We have followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and conducted a comprehensive search of publications from January, 2010 to December 2021 in four high quality academic databases: PubMed, ScienceDirect, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library, and the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) Anthology. We reviewed 6128 publications; 42 met the inclusion criteria. This review identified: 6 datasets having discharge summaries (2 publicly available, 4 acquired from hospitals); 14 NLP techniques along with some other data extraction processes, different feature extraction and embedding techniques. The review also shows that there is a significant increase in the use of deep learning models compared to machine learning. To measure the performance of classification methods, different evaluation metrics are used.

In response to this concern, we propose a novel model T2V_TF based on deep learning by combining both Time2Vec and Transformer technologies. To introduce more diverse information into the proposed model, we further conduct an in-depth exploration of the extraction and fusion of multi-source heterogeneous information, which includes the trading data, time–frequency features, Alpha 101 and Alpha 191 technical indicators, and sentiment scores. Moreover, to increase the ranking ability of our model, T2V_TF takes the ranking loss as the loss function instead of the widely used regression loss. Finally, all the technological innovations of this paper are verified on the portfolio constructed based on the A50 stocks from the Chinese stock market. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed T2V_TF can get better portfolio cumulative return, compared with other models including the multi-layer perceptron, the support vector machine, the gradient boosting decision trees, the long short-term memory model, and the attention-based long short-term memory model, and the Transformer. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",A50 stocks; Multi-source heterogeneous information; Portfolio management; Time2Vec; Transformer,Article,Scopus

The secondary aim is to subsequently assess its application as a post-processing routine for automated EEG grading of background abnormalities in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Methods: A database of neonatal EEG with expertly annotated artefacts was used to train and validate machine learning models to automatically identify EEG epochs containing artefacts. Three approaches were developed and compared, specifically, a simple threshold-based digital signal processing (DSP) method, a machine learning method, and a deep learning method. The artefact detection classifier was subsequently assessed as a post-processing tool to assist in the application of automated EEG grading of HIE. A new deep learning model for grading the EEG was developed by training an existing network on a large, multi-centre dataset. The artefact detection algorithm was integrated into the grading algorithm through a post-processing routine. Results: Using a database containing 19 h of EEG from 51 patients with per-channel and per-second annotations of artefacts, a deep learning convolutional neural network solution achieved best performance for artefact detection with an area under the operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.84, compared to an AUC of 0.68 and 0.82 for a DSP method and a random-kernel ridge-classifier model, respectively. The automated EEG grading algorithm was trained and tested on 653 h of EEG from 181 patients, which achieved an accuracy of 82.8 % (95 % CI: 80.5 % to 85.2 %). The percentage of detected artefacts in the misclassified epochs was not statistically different (p = 0.568) compared to that of correctly classified epochs. Using artefact detection, a small number of epochs were removed from grading, resulting in a minor increase in accuracy for the EEG grading algorithm from 82.6 % to 83.6 %. Conclusion: Deep learning methods achieved highest classification performance for neonatal EEG artefact detection, although a ridge classifier using random kernels achieved comparable performance without significant parameter tuning or training time. The inclusion of artefact detection in automated EEG grading does not significantly improve accuracy in our curated dataset, but does allow for a quality measure to be presented alongside the automated EEG grades which may increase user confidence in its real-world application. © 2022",Artefact detection; Convolutional neural network; EEG; Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy; Machine learning; Neonatal,Article,Scopus

This paper proposed a new method to predict and monitor concrete strength development. The basic idea is using embedded smart aggregates (SAs), combining the electromechanical impedance (EMI) technology and machine learning to monitor the strength development of early-age concrete. An EMI model of the embedded SA was firstly established and the relationship between the conductance resonant frequency (CRF) and conductance resonant peak (CRP) of the SA and the development of concrete strength was investigated. The conductance signatures were continuously monitored and the compressive strength of the specimens at different ages was tested. Hence, the EMI model results that the CRF decreases but CRP increases as the compressive strength of concrete increases were verified by analyzing the collected data. The four different models of a linear regression model (LR), a convolutional neural network (CNN), a hybrid (LR-CNN) model, and an empirical equation were established. The conductance of SAs as the developed models inputs, the compressive strength of specimens as outputs. Finally, these four models were compared with each other. Meanwhile, the performance indicators of the LR-CNN model and other hybrid models were compared. The results show that the LR-CNN model has excellent performance and successfully achieves quantitative prediction of concrete strength development.

The existing solutions mainly focus on domain adaptation by minimizing the data distribution discrepancy with certain metric, which emphasize the common features embedded in the data cross domains and neglect the unique features toward health condition classification in one specific domain. In these solutions, all the data for training have been forced to align in a common feature space and all the features for domain adaptation have been treated equally. However, there might exist domain specific features which are not appropriate for transfer but may contain essential information for classification in specific domain. In addition, due to the difficulty of collecting machine fault data, the number of machine fault samples is usually quite small or even zero. The traditional deep network structures and the training strategy are not the optimal choice in this occasion. To address these problems, a novel multi-view and multi-level network (MMNet) for fault diagnosis is developed. In MMNet, two network channels have been respectively constructed for cross domain common feature and domain specific feature learning to provide multi-view features. This architecture could implicitly differentiate the common features cross domains and the specific features only in one domain. In the channel of domain specific feature, a domain classifier and fault classifier are combined to learn the domain specific features. Multiple kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) is imposed on multiple layers of the common feature channel to implement domain adaptation and extract cross domain common features. The domain classification and fault classification together form a multi-level classification scheme. A classic few shot learning architecture with two modules respectively for feature extraction and relation computation is adopted as the backbone network. The relation score based classification mechanism enables zero shot fault classification in the target domain. Episode based few shot training strategy is employed to enhance the performance of MMNet with few labeled training data. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance of MMNet on the involved transfer tasks. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Fault diagnosis; Feature transferability; Few shot learning; Transfer learning,Article,Scopus

The development of social networks has been driven by the on-going appearance of vast numbers of short documents, such as those in which opinions are expressed and comments are made. The text in these documents reflects users’ emotions related to entities. The ALSA of these short texts plays an important role in solving various problems in life. Particularly in e-commerce, manufacturers can use sentiment analysis to determine users’ orientations, adapt their products to perfection, identify potential users, and pinpoint users that influence other users. Therefore, improving the performance of ALSA methods has recently attracted the interest of researchers. Currently, four main types of ALSA methods are available: knowledge-based, machine learning-based, hybrid-based, and most recently, graph convolutional network (GCN)-based. This study is the first survey to focus on reviewing the proposed methods for ALSA using GCN methods. In this paper, we propose a novel taxonomy to divide GCN-based ALSA models into three categories based on the types of knowledge extraction. We present and compare GCN-based ALSA methods following our taxonomy comprehensively. Common benchmark datasets and text representations that are often used in GCN-based methods are also discussed. In addition, we discuss five challenges and suggest seven future research directions for GCN-based ALSA methods. The findings of our survey are expected to provide the necessary guidelines for beginners, practitioners, and new researchers to improve the performance of ALSA methods. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Aspect-level sentiment analysis; GCNs-based aspect-level sentiment analysis; Graph convolutional network; Sentiment analysis challenges; Sentiment analysis future directions,Short Survey,Scopus

Most of the existing research initiatives propose methods for detecting and predicting epilepsy, which rely on the extraction of handcrafted features and the train of traditional machine learning classifiers. In this paper, we present two new methods to distinguish healthy, interictal, and ictal cases without the time-consuming procedure of feature extraction. Firstly, we apply the short-time fourier transform (STFT) to the single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and construct an image consisting of three channels. This image is passed through pretrained models, including AlexNet, DenseNet201, EfficientNet, ResNet18, etc. Secondly, we introduce a multimodal deep neural network. Specifically, we pass each single-channel EEG signal through two branches of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which can extract low and high frequency features. Also, we apply the short-time fourier transform (STFT) to the EEG signals and create an image consisting of three channels. The image is passed through a pretrained EfficientNet-B7 model. Finally, we employ a gated multimodal unit to control the importance of each modality. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model on five different cases on the EEG database of the University of Bonn and show that our introduced model achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches. © 2022 The Authors",Deep learning; Epilepsy; Gated multimodal unit; Short-time fourier transform; Single-channel EEG,Article,Scopus

Therefore, making ANNs robust against adversarial attacks has received a lot of attention. Backdoor attacks, which causes targeted mis-classification while the accuracy on clean data is not affected, are among the most efficient attacks. In this paper, we propose a method called link-pruning with scale-freeness (LPSF), in which the dormant threatening links from the neurons in the input layer to other neurons of feed-forward neural network are eliminated according to the information gained from a portion of clean input data and the essential links are strengthened by changing the fully-connected networks to scale-free structures. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first defense method that makes the network significantly robust against backdoor attack (BD) before the network is attacked. LPSF is evaluated on feed-forward neural networks and with malicious MNIST, FMNIST, handwritten Chinese characters and HODA datasets.

We provide the rigorous math behind the Merton-LSTM model, which demonstrates that by leveraging the nonlinear learning ability of LSTM with increased model capacity, the Merton-LSTM model is expected to learn the inherent association between the Merton determinants and CDS spreads. Further, the Merton-LSTM model is compared with the machine learning models LSTM, gated recurrent unit (GRU), multilayer perceptron network (MLP), support vector machine (SVM) and a typical stochastic series model in forecasting the two most liquid five-year CDS indices, North America High Yield index (CDX.NA.HY) and North America Investment Grade index (CDX.NA.IG) through the root mean squared error (RMSE) and the Diebold-Mariano test. The comparison results show that the RMSEs of the Merton-LSTM model are the lowest (6.2570–27.2000 for CDX.NA.HY and 1.3168–6.4772 for CDX.NA.IG) compared to other competitive models. The superiority of the Merton-LSTM model in forecasting performance is highlighted in long-term prediction even with a forecasting horizon extended to 28 days. Simulated trading with different thresholds and horizons is conducted in this study.

However, considering that the monitored operational data are often not labelled, supervised machine learning classification methods cannot be directly applied. In this study, based on the idea of graph theory, a framework of interpretable time series pattern recognition methods based on graph structural features is proposed. Firstly, the time series data is segmented into local subsequences by a shapelet-based time series classification method. Secondly, time-graphlets are constructed by means of a visibility graph algorithm and an original graph structure feature-based representation method is proposed. Then, pattern recognition of the different operational states of IES is performed in the form of multidimensional feature vectors. Thirdly, an association rule model is designed to analyze the supply and demand fluctuations, price fluctuations and couplings between multiple energy subsystems, based on which the pattern recognition results are annotated to match the operational characteristics of the IES. Fourthly, a shapelet-based state transfer network graph is constructed, and the complex network centrality metrics are used to analyze the operating characteristics and key operating states of the system over time. The new method is applied for pattern recognition of operational states in a Spanish IES. The results show that the proposed method can increase the interpretability of the recognition results and provide explanatory labels for the operational data. Furthermore, the vulnerable operational states of the system can be revealed, which allows managers to monitor the operational state of the system and take early defensive measures against the more threatening operational patterns. This suggests that the methodological framework presented in this paper is a promising approach to pattern recognition that can provide interpretable annotations for unsupervised operational data of IES and their safe management. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Integrated energy system; Shapelets; Time series pattern recognition; Time-graphlets,Article,Scopus

A comprehensive database consisting 159 experimental results of RC beams with solid or hollow sections was compiled, with input variables including dimension parameters of cross-section, compressive stress of concrete, elastic modulus and strength ratio of reinforcements. The performance of the models was appraised by various statistical estimators and safety ratio, and compared with different theories for cracking torque and initial stiffness. Among all the calculation models, RF model achieved the best overall prediction performance with the highest coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.985 for cracking torque and R2 = 0.978 for initial stiffness) and lowest root-mean-square error (RMSE = 5.867 for cracking torque and RMSE = 3.994 for initial stiffness). However, theories for cracking torque, i.e., plastic theory, Bredt thin-tube theory and skew-bending theory, gave huge underestimation, whereas greatly exaggerated initial stiffness was obtained by elastic theory and simplified soften membrane model for torsion theory. Besides, input variable importance analysis was conducted, revealing that dimension parameters of cross-section were the most critical features to decide prediction performance for pre-cracking torsional performance of RC beams.

In this work we illustrate a literature embedding model, which identifies various risk factors, symptoms, mechanisms, and genes associated with CVD using a query word (i.e., “stroke”), and then based on the collected information the model predicts whether or not a person will be susceptible to CVD. For this purpose, we collected published literature from PubMed using search keywords consisting of a word such as “heart” and 19,264 human gene names, then trained our literature embedding model using the collected abstracts. For the intrinsic evaluation, we analyzed whether or not the captured words and genes were correctly identified as risk factors and associated symptoms for the input query words. For the extrinsic evaluation, we used our embedding model as feature selection and dimensionality reduction tasks on cohort data for CVD prediction. Our model accurately (average accuracy of >96 %) captured associated risk factors, symptoms, and genes for a given input query word (intrinsic evaluation). Using the selected features and reduced dimensions, our method provided better performance for CVD prediction with less computational time when compared with other popular methods (extrinsic evaluation). Our model provided outstanding results for both evaluation tasks, which enables accurate risk factor identification for CVD prediction. Our model has the potential to facilitate easier collation of multifaceted information for better data mining of vast publicly available data so that efficient and accurate risk factors and symptoms can be identified, which enables better-informed decisions for CVD prediction and treatment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Cardiovascular disease prediction; Information retrieval; Knowledge extraction; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Risk factor identification,Article,Scopus

Approaches like clustering-based, distance-based, density-based outlier detection methods have been proposed over the last several years. Recently, outlier detection using deep learning has drawn attention of researchers. Deep learning-based unsupervised techniques (autoencoder) minimize the reconstruction error using each data instance in the dataset and subsequently, data points with higher reconstruction error are treated as outlier points. However, autoencoder based model overestimates the reconstruction error for normal points whereas it is underestimated for outlier points. As a result, genuine outliers are missed by this approach. We propose two techniques to address the issue of reconstruction error stated earlier. Main idea of our techniques is to compute reconstruction error only using ‘normal points’. In the proposed techniques, we identify probable outliers utilizing the clustering approaches intelligently and subsequently, we do not include them in the minimization process of reconstruction error. We exploit recently recognized clustering approach Density Peak Clustering (DPC) to identify the probable outlier points based on density and distance to the higher density points. However, DPC has inherent drawback of setting threshold which plays important role in deciding density. Therefore, Self Organizing Map (SOM) is exploited as another clustering approach in this article. Subsequently, we conducted experiments on synthetic as well as real world datasets and the results show that the proposed technique outperforms the popular existing deep learning model like RandNet, Boosting-based Autoencoder Ensemble method (BAE), One Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) and density-based algorithms like LOF, LDOF, INFLO, and RDOS. © 2022",Autoencoder; Boosting-based autoencoder ensemble (BAE); Density peaks clustering (DPC); One class support vector machine (OCSVM); Outlier detection; Randomized neural network for outlier detection (RandNet); Self organizing map (SOM),Article,Scopus

Lung cancer is asymptomatic, and so, it is unable to detect at the early stage. But, the rapid identification of lung cancer helps for sustaining the survival rate of people. Hence, many researchers develop various techniques for detecting lung cancer by undergoing different studies. Recently, computer technology has been used for solving these diagnosis problems. These developed systems involve diverse deep and machine learning approaches along with certain image-processing techniques for forecasting the severity level of lung cancer. Hence, this methodology plans to develop a novel intelligent method for diagnosing lung cancer. Initially, data is gathered by downloading two benchmark datasets, which include attribute information from various patients' health records. Furthermore, two standard techniques, “Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)” have been used to extract features. Further, the deep features are retrieved from “the pooling layer of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)”. Further to choose the significant features, the feature selection is taken place by the Best Fitness-based Squirrel Search Algorithm (BF-SSA), which is known as optimal feature selection. This hybrid optimization concept is considered to be superior in various domains to explore the search space efficiently and makes better performance in exploiting the feature selection. In the final phase called prediction, High Ranking Deep Ensemble Learning (HR-DEL) takes place concerning five forms of detection models. Finally, the high ranking of all the classifiers yields the final predicted output. The developed HR-DEL makes accurate prediction up to 8.79% better than the conventional methods and provides high robustness by reducing the dispersion or spread of the classification and model efficiency. The classification is performed, and the results are evaluated with the performance comparison of various algorithms. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Convolutional neural network; Feature extraction; High ranking deep ensemble learning; Lung cancer diagnosis; Optimal feature selection; Recurrent neural network,Article,Scopus

Long-term contact of XLPE insulation with vegetation causes partial discharges (PDs) which damage the insulation. Although a cheap and easy to install, contactless detection method was developed using an antenna, there is a lack of classification algorithms for this method. Only two custom machine learning algorithms have been tested so far, and both rendered unsatisfactory results for the real application. This work investigates the use of neural network algorithms for this problem and the application of heterogeneous stacking ensembles using neural networks. We used real data collected from a number of detection stations in the Czech Republic. Also, we limited ourselves to supporting edge computing using devices such as Edge TPU. We propose the application of a heterogeneous stacking ensemble neural network to classify PDs obtained by the contactless method. The algorithm we propose is based on a stacking ensemble with a novel combination of base learners, and the Wide and Deep neural network is used as a meta-learner. We compared the results of our algorithm with other algorithms designated for time series classification. Also, an ablation study of the ensemble was conducted, and satisfactory results were obtained using the proposed algorithm. The ensemble outperformed all algorithms tested and is usable on the edge using AI HW accelerator as the ensemble is only feedforward and contains only well-used and known layers. This research improves our understanding of the classification of PDs using the contactless PD detection method and also introduces a stacking ensemble of convolutional neural network and autoencoders for a time series classification for the first time. © 2022 The Authors",Covered conductor; Ensemble neural network; High impedance fault; Partial discharge; Time series classification,Article,Scopus

The service conditions (e.g., rotating speed, load) of rotating machinery are often complex, and therefore the self-adaptability and generalizability of shock detection methods under variable operating conditions is an issue worthy of in-depth study. In this paper, a novel hybrid method combining a threshold-based method for feature extraction and a machine-learning-based method for pattern recognition is developed. This method consists of two steps. First, an adaptive feature called activated time-domain image (ATDI) is proposed, where two adaptive activation functions are proposed to activate the time-domain vibration signals after being preprocessed. The resulting ATDI feature image is highly adaptive and changes adaptively depending on the operating conditions. Then, a hybrid method combining ATDI and deep neural network (ATDI-DNN) is developed, where a circshift-based data augmentation method is introduced for enriching the ATDI feature images. Finally, the proposed ATDI-DNN method is used for wheel flat detection of a railway vehicle under variable operating conditions. Experiments demonstrate that the ATDI-DNN model trained with samples from one speed level can be directly applied to other speed levels, and its superiority is demonstrated by comparative methods. The proposed method can be extended to shock detection of other similar rotating machinery. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Activated time-domain image; Adaptive activation function; Deep learning; Railway wheel flat; Rotating machinery; Shock detection,Article,Scopus

We analyzed, on a beat-to-beat basis, the P-waves in the sinus rhythm ECGs of 69 patients with a history of PAF and 59 healthy individuals. From each subject's P-waves, we calculated key electrocardiographic metrics, including some which are proposed here for the first time. Using means testing and feature selection methods, we discerned the features which were most useful for classification, and trained a Random Forest which identified PAF patients. Our approach achieved a 93.45% accuracy, sensitivity of 95.21%, and specificity of 91.40% using P-wave integral and novel amplitude and slope-based features which ranked highest in importance compared to other metrics from the literature. In particular, descriptive statistics of P-wave amplitudes, slopes, and integrals, were effective for identifying subjects with PAF history vs. healthy individuals. Our method has a high sensitivity and discrimination ability, with an AUC=0.9669 which is superior to others’, and can thus be potentially valuable for the early identification of patients who are prone to episodes of PAF, even as part of the standard cardiological checkup that most adults undergo periodically. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Classification; Machine learning; P wave; PAF; Random forest; Sinus rhythm,Article,Scopus

However, it has been very challenging to design an ML-based detection system using heterogeneous network data samples originating from different sources and organisations. This is mainly due to privacy concerns and the lack of a universal format of datasets. In this paper, we propose a collaborative cyber threat intelligence sharing scheme to allow multiple organisations to join forces in the design, training, and evaluation of a robust ML-based network intrusion detection system. The threat intelligence sharing scheme utilises two critical aspects for its application; the availability of network data traffic in a common format to allow for the extraction of meaningful patterns across data sources and the adoption of a federated learning mechanism to avoid the necessity of sharing sensitive users’ information between organisations. As a result, each organisation benefits from the intelligence of other organisations while maintaining the privacy of its data internally. In this paper, the framework has been designed and evaluated using two key datasets in a NetFlow format known as NF-UNSW-NB15-v2 and NF-BoT-IoT-v2. In addition, two other common scenarios are considered in the evaluation process; a centralised training method where local data samples are directly shared with other organisations and a localised training method where no threat intelligence is shared. The results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed framework by designing a universal ML model effectively classifying various benign and intrusive traffic types originating from multiple organisations without the need for inter-organisational data exchange. © 2022, The Author(s).",Cyber threat intelligence; Federated learning; Machine learning; NetFlow; Network intrusion detection,Article,Scopus

Recently, machine learning has been applied to enhance NIDS capability. To train a supervised machine-learning model, a large number of labeled training samples are required to achieve practical performance. However, labeling data samples is a costly task. Additionally, obtaining anomaly data samples is difficult because trends in network traffic that are subject to NIDS change daily, and new attacks continue to be generated. To address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised machine-learning-based NIDS that reduces the required number of labeled training samples by applying an adversarial auto-encoder (AAE) technique. We evaluated the proposed method through a series of experiments and confirmed that the proposed AAE-based NIDS achieves performance comparable to that of multi-layer perceptron-based NIDS with only 0.1% of the labeled training samples. We also confirmed that the selection of data samples for annotation does not affect the performance of the proposed AAE-based NIDS. We also evaluated the relationship between the performance of the proposed method and the dimension of its latent-variable vector. The best performance as measured by recall and F1 score occurred when the dimensionality of the latent variable vector was 10, which suggests that this structure allows for accurate decomposition of attack and normal. This study presents promising results obtained by the proposed semi-supervised learning method with a reduced number of labeled training samples, which reduces the operational costs of a machine-learning-based NIDS. © 2022, The Author(s).",Adversarial auto-encoder; Network intrusion detection system; Semi-supervised learning,Article,Scopus

These online platforms are then attracting an increasing number of users that continuously access, download/upload resources and interact each other during their teaching/learning processes, which is even accelerating by the breakout of COVID-19. In this context, academic institutions are generating large volumes of learning-related data that can be analysed for supporting teachers in lesson, course or faculty degree planning, as well as administrations in university strategic level. However, managing such amount of data, usually coming from multiple heterogeneous sources and with attributes sometimes reflecting semantic inconsistencies, constitutes an emerging challenge, so they require common definition and integration schemes to easily fuse them, with the aim of efficiently feeding machine learning models. In this regard, semantic web technologies arise as a useful framework for the semantic integration of multi-source e-learning data, allowing the consolidation, linkage and advanced querying in a systematic way. With this motivation, the e-LION (e-Learning Integration ONtology) semantic model is proposed for the first time in this work to operate as data consolidation approach of different e-learning knowledge-bases, hence leading to enrich on-top analysis. For demonstration purposes, the proposed ontological model is populated with real-world private and public data sources from different LMSs referring university courses of the Software Engineering degree of the University of Malaga (Spain) and the Open University Learning. In this regard, a set of four case studies are worked for validation, which comprise advance semantic querying of data for feeding predictive modelling and time-series forecasting of students’ interactions according to their final grades, as well as the generation of SWRL reasoning rules for student's behaviour classification.

However, existing methods struggle with industrial applications, which are often challenged by non-ideal datasets. In many cases, the datasets are small, poorly labeled, noisy, or have unbalanced class distribution, or any combination of such problems. In this contribution, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) strategy that is able to circumvent limitations imposed by very small datasets. As case study, we use the extrapolation of corrosion in automobiles and feed our deep learning framework with only few dozen images, as opposed to the thousands to million images commonly found in many computer vision problems. In order to handle such a reduced dataset, we use one GAN for the rust level and one for the rust texture. The rust level GAN is conditional on random samples from the dataset and uses an additive random noise in the latent space to add variability to the generated rust level maps. The rust texture GAN adds the shades of brown to the outputs of the rust level GAN. To improve the robustness of our approach, the rust level GAN is a conditional GAN with random noise added in the latent space of the generator; while the rust texture GAN uses supervised loss functions coming from the observed data set as well as an unsupervised loss function coming from the rust level GAN. In addition, given the very reduced size of our dataset, it is unfeasible to break down the data into training, validation, and test sets. We overcome this limitation by using the discrepancy between the generated and target distributions of the rust level and texture intensities as a way to monitor convergence of training.

However, student retention is yet a widely recognized challenge faced in self-paced education. While many studies have examined the potential of the use of data about student interaction with learning technologies to predict student success, studies that focus on self-paced education are scarce. To address this gap in the literature, this paper reports on the findings of a study that has investigated the performance of a well-known deep learning technique i.e., Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), in the prediction of students at risk of failing a course offered in a self-paced mode of online education. The study has utilized a freely accessible Open University Learning Analytics Dataset comprising 22,437 students with 69 % pass, and 31 % failed instances. The deep LSTM shows the highest predictive power to classify between pass and fail students, compared to all other alternatives by achieving an accuracy of 84.57 %, precision of 82.24 % and recall of 79.43 %. Interestingly, with only first five weeks of course activity log data used for training, the receiver operating characteristic based diagnostic accuracy of the LSTM algorithm is achieved up to 71 %, that outperforms almost all other conventional algorithms - despite trained on the complete dataset collected for the entire duration of the course i.e. up to 38 weeks. Furthermore, this study has also employed a shapely additive explanation model to identify the most important predictors of student retention, e.g., assessment submission and attempted quizzes. This approach is essential in order to increase the interpretability of deep learning techniques and, thus, increase their potential to generate actionable insights. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Deep learning; Early prediction; Long short-term memory (LSTM); Machine learning; Students at risk; Virtual learning environment (VLE),Article,Scopus

Existing deep learning methods do not sufficiently extract the correlation relationship between samples, and the process of extracting features is easily disturbed by noise. Therefore, the accuracy of rotating machinery fault diagnosis needs further improvement. A graph-weighted reinforcement network (GWRNet) is proposed to accurately diagnose the faults of rotating machines under small samples and strong noise. First, an adjacency matrix was constructed by measuring the Euclidean distance of the time- and frequency-domain characteristics of small samples to achieve the pre-classification of nodes. Second, the node feature aggregation strategy was designed by dynamically enhancing the largest weight of the multiheaded attention matrix to suppress strong noise interference. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified using datasets from the drivetrain diagnostics simulator (DDS) test rig and wind turbine gearboxes. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Fault diagnosis; Graph weighted reinforcement networks; Rotating machinery; Small samples; Strong noise,Article,Scopus

For such structures, long-term temperature data holds the potential for data-driven prediction of expected structural behavior, which in turn enables the detection of anomalous structural behavior. For this reason, structural health monitoring (SHM) strategies typically employ temperature sensors. However, the success of SHM is contingent on the quantity and quality of the available temperature data. Hence, accurate automatic methods for the detection and quantification of anomalies in temperature data are needed. In particular, gradual temperature sensor drifts are difficult to detect and can introduce errors into the thermal compensation of strain sensors, which can be erroneously confounded with time-dependent structural behavior. Current data-driven methods use air temperature as predictor because it exhibits good correlation with temperatures in the structure. Sensor drift is typically quantified by analysis of the prediction residuals; however, these methods are not robust to outliers and can be affected by seasonal biases. In this work, a probabilistic neural network is used as the nonlinear data-driven temperature prediction model which enables the introduction of a sensible threshold to mitigate seasonal model bias. Furthermore, a novel drift detection method based on the evolution of parameters of a trinomial probability distribution is introduced, together with a robust drift quantification method. The performance of this method is assessed using real temperature data from a pedestrian bridge, spanning over seven years of the structure's life. © 2022 The Author(s)",Anomaly detection; Data validation; Data-driven prediction; Fiber optics; Long-term structural health monitoring; Machine learning; Probabilistic neural networks; Temperature prediction; Temperature sensor drift,Article,Scopus

Therefore, it is of great significance to accurately identify the faults of DC-DC Buck circuit. Due to the high cost of collecting circuit fault data set, the lack of effective fault data will lead to the inability to establish an intelligent fault diagnosis model. In this paper, the model of source circuit with sufficient data is used to solve the problem of fault diagnosis of target circuit with lack of data. A deep transfer kernel extreme learning machine auto encoder (DKEA) model is designed. The activation function of Gaussian error linear units (GELU) is used to describe the probability of neuron input, and the kernel extreme learning machine is employed as the classifier to complete the diagnosis task. First, only the output voltage signal of the circuit is collected to extract its primary features in time and frequency domain, and then the primary features are mined and classified by using the deep extreme learning machine auto encoder (ELM-AE) model. Sufficient source domain data is used to train the deep ELM-AE model, and the parameters obtained are used as the initialization parameters of the target domain diagnosis model. With the help of transfer learning, a small number of training samples in the target domain are used to fine-tune the deep ELM-AE model to adapt to the remaining testing samples in the target domain. The experimental results proves that the proposed method can effectively achieve the transfer diagnosis between different DC-DC Buck circuits based on the source domain data. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",DC-DC Buck circuit; Deep ELM-AE model; Fault diagnosis; Kernel method; Transfer learning,Article,Scopus

The credibility of such reviews is of paramount significance and any compromise of the process can lead to unwanted consequences both for customers and businesses. As such, the need for a method by which deceptive reviews are identified is evident to protect community and businesses alike. Deceptive reviews typically exhibit distinctive linguistic clues which can be detected, raising a flag about the credibilty of the user who posted them. Specifically, discursive features that show in such texts can be a useful tool in checking the credibility of reviews. Manually analysing the discourse and different rhetorical structures can be a tedious and timeconsuming process allowing some deceptive reviews to remain publically available. However, coupled with artificial intelligence tools such as deep learning approaches, discourse analysis could be performed in a manner that is both efficient and timely. The proposed study used a balanced publically available deceptive and truthful reviews dataset to design a discourse analysis based credibility check scheme with high accuracy.

Recording and analyzing bee sounds became a fundamental part of recent initiatives in the development of so-called smart hives. The majority of researches on beehive sound analytics are focusing on swarming detection, a relatively simple binary classification task (due to the obvious difference in the sound of a swarming and a non-swarming bee colony) where machine learning models achieve good performance even when trained on small data. However, in the case of more complex tasks of beehive sound analytics, even modern machine learning approaches perform poorly. First, training such models would need a large dataset but, according to our knowledge, there is no publicly available large-scale beehive audio data. Second, due to the specifics of beehive sounds, efficient noise filtering methods would be required, however, we could not find a noise filtering method that would increase the performance of machine learning models substantially. In this paper, we propose a dynamic noise filtering method applicable on spectrograms (image representations of audio data) which is superior to the most popular image noise filtering baselines. Further, we introduce a multi-class classification task of bee sounds and a large-scale dataset consisting of 10.000 beehive audio recordings. Finally, we provide the results of a large-scale experiment involving various combinations of audio feature extraction and noise filtering methods together with various deep learning models.

However, machine learning and deep learning models are notorious for their black-box structure. To build human-friendly interpretability in stock price prediction, many studies focus on the relationship between input features and the outcome by measuring the feature importance. However, the feature-importance-based interpretability methods have such drawbacks as relative feature importance, vague importance of correlated features, and impractical interpretability. Furthermore, they overlook two principal characteristics of time series stock price data: time-dependency and collective behavior of features. As a solution to catch the collective behavior of features over a whole data period, we propose the best feature subset selection. Additionally, for the solution to reflect the time-dependent characteristic of stock price data over a short data period, we propose piecewise best feature subset selection. The proposed algorithm uses two separate input feature sets: internal technical indicators and external market prices. This bilateral forecasting scheme goes through a two-stage feature selection process composed of feature set expansion, hybridized genetic algorithm-machine learning regressions to select important features, and importance score filtering to select optimal features. Finally, the best feature subset is selected for forecasting and interpretation. The proposed method achieves the best feature subset of parsimoniously fewer features for interpretability and improves average forecasting Root Mean Squared Error by 10.42% for the optimal feature set and 13.47% for the best feature subset of the internal technical indicators. For enhanced local interpretability in this study, we use Savitzky–Golay smoothing as part of piecewise optimal curve fitting to examine each potential grouping of external features. The proposed local interpretability technique using piecewise optimal curve fitting and piecewise best feature subset provides a more timely-flexible interpretation of stock price behavior using a few best features for piecewise data segments. Compared with other feature-importance interpretability techniques that only rely on either a single data point or a whole data period, the proposed interpretability technique overcomes their limitations, and reflects the main characteristics of time series data. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Collective behavior of features; Genetic algorithm feature selection; Interpretable stock forecasting; ML regression competition; Piecewise optimal curve fitting; Savitzky–Golay smoothing; Timely flexible interpretation,Article,Scopus

To address missing credit information, many researchers have used borrowers’ social interactions as an alternative data source. Exploiting social networking data has traditionally been achieved by hand-crafted feature engineering, but lately, graph neural networks have emerged as a promising alternative. Here we introduce an information-processing framework to improve credit scoring models by blending several methods of graph representation learning: feature engineering, graph embeddings, and graph neural networks. In this approach, we aggregate the methods’ outputs to be fed to a gradient boosting classifier to produce a final creditworthiness score. We have validated this framework over a unique multi-source dataset that characterizes the relationships, interactions, and credit history for the entire population of a Latin American country, applying it to credit risk models, application, and behavior. It also allows us to study both individuals and companies. Our results show that the methods of graph representation learning should be used as complements; they should not be seen as self-sufficient methods, as it is currently done. We improve the creditworthiness assessment performance in terms of the measures of Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) and Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS), outperforming traditional methods of exploiting social interaction data. In the area of corporate lending, where the potential gain is much higher, our results confirm that the evaluation of a thin-file company cannot solely consider the company's own characteristics. The business ecosystem in which these companies interact with their owners, suppliers, customers, and other companies provides novel knowledge that enables financial institutions to enhance their creditworthiness assessment. Our results let us know when and on which population to use graph data and the expected effects on performance.

It is normal for people to anticipate speech interfaces with computer. For real-time intelligent applications, it is necessary that the machine can hear, understand, investigate, and take action upon receiving the input information from speaker. This can be taken by introducing an Automatic Speech Recognition system, which translates an audio signal into a written text or a command without understanding what has been recognized. Several methods are designed for speech recognition, but accuracy is a most challenging task. Hence, this paper develops a novel Taylor Gradient Descent Political Optimizer (Taylor GDPO) based deep learning model for speech recognition. A developed Taylor GDPO is obtained by integrating Taylor series, Gradient Descent (GD) and Political Optimizer (PO). Firstly, pre-processing of an input signal is done and the features are extracted. Then, the extracted features are given as input to the Deep Residual Network (DRN), which is trained by the developed Taylor GDPO. A developed model provided effectual efficiency with the highest accuracy of 96.93%, smallest False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 2.44%, smallest False Rejection Rate (FRR) of 2.10%, smallest Mean squared error (MSE) of 0.038. © 2022",Bark frequency cepstral coefficients; Deep residual network; Spectral centroid; Speech recognition; Tonal power ratio,Article,Scopus

Tamil language has 247 character classes and is widely spoken by the people in India (Tamil Nadu), Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka and so on. For considering the large character sets with their general and handwritten complexities, the two-stage feature extraction process has been experimented with to represent the character's structure. In the initial stage, the character's image is divided into nine equal zones and the structural features were extracted from each zone by the directional algorithmic approach, which denotes unique shape possibilities represented in zone divisions. A classification test has been performed to identify characters in this stage, but a structural portion of handwritten characters like unwanted loops and curves leads to negative results. Hence, locational features have been introduced to identify the position of structures. Each zone is subdivided into four quads further and the pixel availability has been taken as features from the quads to provide the solution for unnecessary portions and loops. With directional features taken from upper (3 columns × 1 row) and lower zones (3 columns × 1 row), corresponding location features have been added up for labeling a unique shape. Finally, to classify the characters, the directional features taken from middle zones (3 columns × 1 row) and their respective locational features have been added with labeled shapes of upper and lower zones. A suitable machine learning algorithm has been chosen for classifying the character classes. HP-Lab-India dataset and two different handwritten documents collected from the people of Tamil Nadu, India, have been tested by these approaches. This experimental research shows significant improvement in recognizing accurate characters. The final results of this approach have created a benchmark for the recognition of handwritten Tamil characters. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Directional and locational Features; Quad divisions; Shape prediction; Support Vector Machine; Tamil handwritten character recognition,Article,Scopus

Since different parameter values can have a different number of real solutions, the parameter space is decomposed into regions whose boundary forms the real discriminant locus. This article views locating the real discriminant locus as a supervised classification problem in machine learning where the goal is to determine classification boundaries over the parameter space, with the classes being the number of real solutions. This article presents a novel sampling method which carefully samples a multidimensional parameter space. At each sample point, homotopy continuation is used to obtain the number of real solutions to the corresponding polynomial system. Machine learning techniques including nearest neighbors, support vector classifiers, and neural networks are used to efficiently approximate the real discriminant locus. One application of having learned the real discriminant locus is to develop a real homotopy method that only tracks real solution paths unlike traditional methods which track all complex solution paths. Examples show that the proposed approach can efficiently approximate complicated solution boundaries such as those arising from the equilibria of the N=4 Kuramoto model which was previously intractable using traditional methods. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Deep learning; Discriminant locus; Machine learning; Numerical algebraic geometry,Article,Scopus

Filtering fake news manually from social media platforms is nearly impossible, as such an act raises security and privacy concerns for users.

However, the correct identification of trajectory phases, and thus treatment regimens, is challenging. In this paper, we propose a data-driven, dynamic approach for identifying trajectory phases of chronic diseases and thus suggesting treatment regimens. Specifically, we develop a novel variable-duration copula hidden Markov model (VDC-HMMX). In our VDC-HMMX, the trajectory is modeled as a series of latent states with acute, stable, and unstable phases, which are eventually recovered. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our VDC-HMMX model on the basis of a longitudinal study with 928 patients suffering from low back pain. A myopic classifier identifies correct treatment regimens with a balanced accuracy of slightly above 70%. In comparison, our VDC-HMMX model is correct with a balanced accuracy of 83.65%.

In our MSSP, a company has to staff multiple shifts for each workday in the presence of uncertain arrival rates that vary throughout the day and patient “customers” that do not abandon the queue while waiting for a service, but who must be served by some pre-defined time. Drawing on established methods in both capacity management and prescriptive analytics, we propose to use fluid and stationary approximations of the demand arrival process to apply tailored prescriptive analytics approaches to determine staffing levels for multiple interrelated shifts. The prescriptive analytics approaches rely on machine learning techniques that incorporate a detailed representation of the non-stationary structure of arrivals and leverage extensive auxiliary data. In particular, we adapt established prescriptive analytics approaches—weighted sample average approximation and kernelized empirical risk minimization—and propose a new optimization prediction approach to solving the multi-shift staffing problem.

A mouse model with overt dystonia is of unique importance to better understand the DYT1 pathophysiology and evaluate preclinical drug efficacy. DYT1 dystonia is likely a network disorder involving multiple brain regions, particularly the basal ganglia. Tor1a conditional knockout in the striatum or cerebral cortex leads to motor deficits, suggesting the importance of corticostriatal connection in the pathogenesis of dystonia. Indeed, corticostriatal long-term depression impairment has been demonstrated in multiple targeted DYT1 mouse models. Pappas and colleagues developed a conditional knockout line (Dlx-CKO) that inactivated Tor1a in the forebrain and surprisingly displayed overt dystonia. We set out to validate whether conditional knockout affecting both cortex and striatum would lead to overt dystonia and whether machine learning-based video behavioral analysis could be used to facilitate high throughput preclinical drug screening. We generated Dlx-CKO mice and found no overt dystonia or motor deficits at 4 months. At 8 months, retesting revealed motor deficits in rotarod, beam walking, grip strength, and hyperactivity in the open field; however, no overt dystonia was visually discernible or through the machine learning-based video analysis. Consistent with other targeted DYT1 mouse models, we observed age-dependent deficits in the beam walking test, which is likely a better motor behavioral test for preclinical drug testing but more labor-intensive when overt dystonia is absent. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Beam walking; Dlx-Cre; Dystonia; DYT1; Tor1a; TorsinA,Article,Scopus

In this paper we present a literature study performed to evaluate the current state of the use of machine learning methods within the field of gas hydrates with specific focus on the oil chemistry. A common analysis technique for crude oils is Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) which could be a good approach to achieving a better understanding of the chemical composition of hydrates, and the use of machine learning in the field of FT-ICR MS was therefore also examined. Several machine learning methods were identified as promising, their use in the literature was reviewed and a text analysis study was performed to identify the main topics within the publications. The literature search revealed that the publications on the combination of FT-ICR MS, machine learning and gas hydrates is limited to one. Most of the work on gas hydrates is related to thermodynamics, while FT-ICR MS is mostly used for chemical analysis of oils. However, with the combination of FT-ICR MS and machine learning to evaluate samples related to gas hydrates, it could be possible to improve the understanding of the composition of hydrates and thereby identify hydrate active compounds responsible for the differences between oils forming plugging hydrates and oils forming transportable hydrates. © 2022 The Authors",Chemometrics; Crude oil; FT-ICR MS; Gas hydrates; Machine learning,Review,Scopus

The CO2 injection into the oil reservoir can noticeably change the density of solution. In addition, forecasting this parameter over a wide range of conditions is extremely challenging due to the complicated behaviors of hydrocarbons. The earlier empirical models are only valid for specific hydrocarbons under very restricted conditions. Therefore, in this study, three robust machine learning based approaches were implemented to build robust and universal models based on an immense databank, comprising 17,168 experimental data extracted from 52 independent studies. The databank covered 46 varied mixtures at a broad range of conditions, including temperature, pressure and CO2 mole fraction. The statistical and the cumulative frequency analyzes showed that the radial basis function (RBF) model provides the best results among the all approaches, with an average absolute relative error of 1.61 % and a relative root mean squared error (RRMSE) of 4.29 %, respectively for the test data samples. It also provided favorable predictions for physical attitudes of the mixture density under different operating conditions, and properly described the “density crossover” phenomenon at high CO2 concentrations.

Although some attempts have been made to search for the synergy from co-liquefying various feedstocks, these processes were remarkably time and labor consuming, and often with low rate of success. Therefore, this study for the first time employed machine learning algorithms to mine the synergistic effect in co-HTL. Started with single task prediction, three machine learning algorithms, including Adaboost, Gradient Boosting Regression and Random Forest, were trained and tested for predicting co-HTL biocrude yield and relative co-liquefaction effect (CE). It was found that their prediction performances were favorable over traditional mathematical equations, in which Gradient Boosting Regression exhibited the best performance for co-HTL biocrude yield prediction (training and testing R2 of 0.976 and 0.812 respectively), and Adaboost better estimated relative CE. Feature importance analysis further revealed that co-HTL biocrude yield was mainly influenced by the reaction temperature, but relative CE was closely related to mixed feedstock's lipid and carbohydrate content, implying that the synergism/antagonism from co-HTL was more dependent on the biochemical composition of mixed feedstock than reaction conditions. Multitask predictions, estimating biocrude yield and relative CE simultaneously that are usually required in real co-HTL practices, suggested Adaboost was the most satisfying algorithm (training R2 of 0.922) among studied ones. An optimal relative CE of 22.07 % along with 36.31 wt% (daf) biocrude yield could be obtained when the mixed feedstock contained 42.93 % protein, 50.49 % carbohydrate, 6.58 % lipid at a temperature of 320 °C, which were in well agreement with experimental results from co-HTL of biomass model components. A mini application software (exe. file including machine learning algorithm) was also developed for quick estimation of synergy and co-HTL biocrude yield by simply inputting mixed feedstock's biochemical composition and reaction conditions, showing promising potential for academic and industrial practices to mine the co-HTL synergy and design processes efficiently. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Application software; Biocrude yield; Hydrothermal co-liquefaction; Machine learning algorithm; Synergy,Article,Scopus

We hypothesize there is an implicit but discernable link between IR spectra of rocks and their mechanical response that can be learned by a machine learning (ML) algorithm. Our rationale is that IR spectra are sensitive to both rock composition and microstructure, two attributes that determine all hydro-thermo-mechanical properties of the rock. To test this hypothesis, we confine ourselves to shale specimens from the Green River formation, Utah, US, and aim to map acoustic velocity (Vp), acoustic attenuation coefficient (Ap), and X-ray attenuation coefficient (µ) from hyperspectral images acquired in the near-, shortwave-, and mid-IR. We propose an experimental workflow that generates large quantities of labelled data needed to train supervised ML algorithms. The trained algorithms are shown to accurately predict Vp, Ap, and µ directly from pixelwise IR spectra. In some cases, even a 1% random sampling of pixels is found sufficient for training. While both artificial and convolutional neural networks are probed, performances are similar, but better than linear regression. More important is ensuring the training data are representative of all lithologies to be targeted during prediction.

Twenty feedstock samples are chosen for predicting the biodiesel thermo-physical properties and are validated with the available experimental data within a maximum error of 14 %. To evaluate the thermo-physical properties of a variety of feedstock, the predicted data are used for training an artificial neural network (ANN) and the developed ANN function is used for generating the various thermophysical properties of biodiesel fuels based on their composition and temperature. A good agreement is observed between the predicted and ANN results with a maximum mean absolute percentage error of 10 %.

Traditional coal proximate analysis mainly uses chemical analysis methods, which have the disadvantages of slow speed and high cost. This paper proposed an approach combining reflectance spectroscopy with deep learning (DL) for rapid proximate analysis of coal. First, 80 sets of coal spectral data are enhanced by data augmentation, outlier detection, and dimensional transformation to improve the number and quality of samples. Then, an analytical model combining dilated convolution, multi-level residual connection, and a two-hidden-layer extreme learning machine (TELM), named DR_TELM, was proposed. The model extracted effective features from coal spectral data by a convolutional neural network (CNN) and utilized TELM as a regressor to achieve feature identification and content prediction. The experimental results showed that DR_TELM achieved coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.981, 0.989, 0.990, 0.985, 0.989 and root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.533, 1.833, 1.111, 1.808, 0.723 for the content prediction of moisture, ash, volatile matter, fixed carbon and higher heating value (HHV), respectively.

One example utilizes Laguerre–Gaussian beams carrying orbital angular momentum to increase bit transfer rate by spatially multiplexing information into an alphabet of symbols, sized 2N, where N is the number of bits encoded in each symbol. This system uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to demultiplex the information, which has been shown to be capable of high levels of accuracy even in turbid environments or in the presence of significant optical turbulence. However, it has been observed that CNNs struggle when shown images affected by physical environmental effects (different levels of turbulence, optical magnification, beam misalignment) that were not present in the training set. In this paper we further investigate physical beam misalignment under two experimental conditions, quiescent and strong optical turbulence. Physical beam misalignment is defined as a translation of the beam at the receiver. Our optically turbulent environment is characterized using the scintillation of a Gaussian beam, and is estimated to have a refractive index structure constant value of ?10?11m?2/3. We use two alphabet sizes, of 16 and 256 symbols, and demonstrate classification of received images in a combination of scenarios with adequate success (&gt;90% accuracy) when training and testing under the same conditions, and using a pre-trained CNN, AlexNet. However, when training and testing under physically misaligned conditions, we demonstrate an issue with impractical rates of classification, at 5%–50%. Our investigation provides CNN classification at significantly higher levels of complexity than previously seen, both in terms of experimental turbulence strength and number of classifiable symbols (alphabet size), and clearly demonstrates the importance of carefully designed experiments to aid the machine learning training process for communication systems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Convolutional neural network; Laguerre–Gaussian beam; Optical turbulence; Orbital angular momentum; Propagation through complex media; Underwater wireless optical communication,Article,Scopus

Data-driven chatter detection and prediction is critical to achieve high surface quality and process efficiency. Most existing chatter detection approaches are based on external sensors, such as accelerometers and microphones, which require installation of extra devices. Some recent studies have proved the feasibility of online chatter detection using internal signals such as drive motor current. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of different internal signals extracted from CNC system for chatter detection and compare them with external acceleration signals. The external and internal signals are first compared with time–frequency analysis using Discrete Fourier Transform and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition approaches. Two chatter detection methods are then presented based on manually and automatically extracted features respectively. The first method uses two nonlinear dimensionless indicators, C0 complexity and Power Spectral Entropy, of filtered signals. The second approach uses autoencoder for automatic feature extraction and Support Vector Machine as classifier for chatter identification. A series of milling experiments are conducted and chatters are intentionally created by changing the milling process parameters. Multiple internal signals are collected using software provided by the machine manufacturer. Results show that several internal CNC signals, such as the nominal current signal and the actual torque signal, can achieve comparable performance to external signals for chatter detection. © 2022 The Author(s)",Autoencoder; Chatter detection; Empirical mode decomposition; Internal signal; Milling process,Article,Scopus

Early detection of water leaks in pipe networks is crucial for implementing countermeasures to reduce structural damage and water losses. The method of data collection based on sensors installed in pipeline networks has gained a lot of attention due to its potential for application in real-time monitoring systems for leak detection. However, many models developed on data collected from simulations, engineered tests or field experiments, and few have been validated using real network data. To make further investigations in real water distribution systems (WDSs), machine learning (ML)-based leak detection models were developed and validated using signal data collected by piezoelectric accelerometers installed in WDSs over several cities of China. Nonlinear features describing the non-stationary characteristics contained in leak signals are extracted from the signals to build feature sets as inputs to the common classifiers, i.e., support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). In addition, the spectrograms obtained by the short-time Fourier transform processing are used for the convolutional neural network SqueezeNet. The effects of different features, different dataset compositions, and different models for leak detection are compared and analyzed. SqueezeNet has the best performance with 95.15% accuracy in identifying leaks, and KNN is the best of the three classifiers with superior sensitivity and 88.17% accuracy in identification. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness and practicability of using machine learning models to identify leaks in real pipe networks. The application of machine learning models can perform effective leak detection with minimal human intervention, thus providing a meaningful contribution to the study of leak detection in real WDSs. The proposed model aims to identify leakages under operational conditions in real-life pipe networks with higher efficiency and reduced manual involvement.

Thanks to the rise in popularity of machine learning techniques, the number of purely data-driven approaches that try to tackle the issue of vibration-based condition monitoring has also drastically improved. Instead of directly using the vibration measurement data as input to a machine learning model, this work first exploits the cyclostationary characteristics inherent to vibration waveforms originating from rotating machinery. The proposed methodology first estimates the two-dimensional cyclic spectral coherence map of a vibration signal in order to decompose the cyclic modulations on the cyclic and carrier frequency plane. While this provides an effective tool to visualize any potential modulation signatures of faulty gears or bearings, it does not allow for easy inspection over time due to its dimensions. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes an unsupervised deep learning approach to wield this vast amount of data as a tool for detecting persistent changes in the modulation characteristics of the vibration signals. In the first phase, a deep autoencoder learns to reconstruct predictions of the cyclic coherence maps based on unlabeled healthy vibration data and the machine operating conditions. Two post-processing steps improve the predictions by mitigating frequency shifts and outlier or noisy measurements. Lastly, the residual error between the predicted and the actual coherence map is then aggregated and employed for further alarming based on thresholds. The autoencoder model is trained using five years of gearbox vibration data from five different wind turbines. The methodology is then validated on two faulty and eight healthy turbines. The results confirm that the proposed approach can deliver clear indications of failure for the faulty turbine while being completely devoid of any significant alarm trends for the healthy turbines. Thanks to the combination of highly effective cyclostationary signal processing with deep learning while using the operating conditions, the proposed methodology can detect and track incipient mechanical faults from non-stationary vibration data of rotating machinery. Lastly, it is important to emphasize that the proposed method is capable of learning the healthy behavior on one turbine and predicting the expected behavior on another turbine. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Cyclic spectral coherence; Deep learning; Fault detection; Unsupervised learning; Vibration signals,Article,Scopus

Herein, major dissolved ions, multi-isotopes (?34S, ?18Osulfate, ?2H and ?18Owater), machine learning (Self-organizing maps) and Bayesian isotope mixing model were used to identify the source and evolution of SO42? in an abandoned mine (Fengfeng mine, northern China) with a multi-layer groundwater system. Groundwater in the study area was mainly divided into three clusters (Cluster I, Cluster II and Cluster III), dominated by Na-SO4, Ca-SO4 and Ca-HCO3 types, respectively. According to ?2H and ?18Owater, groundwater in the study area mainly originated from atmospheric precipitation. ?34S, ?18Osulfate and SO42? suggested that bacterial sulfate reduction did not affect the SO42? isotopic composition. Dual SO42? isotopes, and MixSIAR model revealed that the main source of SO42? in the study area was pyrite oxidation/gypsum dissolution, accounting for an average of 57.4 % (gypsum), 71.24 % (pyrite oxidation) and 52.93 % (pyrite oxidation) of SO42? in the samples of Clusters I–III, respectively. Combined with the hydrochemical diagrams, the evolution of SO42? in different clusters of samples was derived. Cluster I was mainly gypsum dissolution; In contrast, Clusters II and III were mainly pyrite oxidation accompanied by carbonate dissolution, and Cluster II was also influenced by cation exchange.

To cope with present and future climate change scenarios, it is important to map the shoreline position over years and assess the coastal erosion trends to select the best risk management solutions and guarantee a sustainable management of communities, structures, and ecosystems. However, this objective is particularly challenging on gentle-sloping sandy coasts, where also small sea-level changes trigger significant morphological evolutions. This study presents a multidisciplinary study combining satellite images with Machine Learning and GIS-based spatial tools to analyze short-term shoreline evolution trends and detect erosion hot-spots on the Venice coast over the period 2015–2019. Firstly, advanced image preprocessing, which is not frequently adopted in coastal erosion studies, was performed on satellite images downloaded within the same tidal range. Secondly, different Machine Learning classification methods were tested to accurately define shoreline position by recognizing the land-sea interface in each image. Finally, the application of the Digital Shoreline Analysis System tool was performed to evaluate and visualize coastal changes over the years. Overall, the case study littoral reveals to be stable or mainly subjected to accretion. This is probably due to the high presence of coastal protection structures that stabilize the beaches, enhancing deposition processes. In detail, with respect to the total length of the considered shoreline (about 83 km), 5 % of the coast is eroding, 36 % is stable, 52 % is accreting and 7 % is not evaluable. Despite a significant coastal erosion risk was not recognized within this region, well-delimited erosion hot-spots were mapped in correspondence of Caorle, Jesolo and Cavallino-Treporti municipalities.

Therefore, five high-speed and highly accurate hybrid models were developed and compared to simulate diffuse radiation based on the aerosol optical properties and radiation parameters provided by the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN), Wuhan University, Chinese Ecosystem Research Network (CERN), GLASS surface albedo data, and combined radiative transfer model (RTM) with machine learning (ML) models that include random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), deep neural networks (DNN), and convolutional neural network (CNN). Furthermore, the uncertainty in the simulated diffuse radiation due to the measurement uncertainties of aerosol optical properties and land surface albedo was quantified, and the relative contributions of multiple variables to diffuse radiation were analyzed. The results showed that RTM-RF was the most successful, with determination coefficients (R2) of 0.95, 0.94, and 0.98, and minimum root mean square errors (RMSE) of 9.56, 10.05, and 13.27 W m?2 at the Lulin, Wuhan, and Xianghe sites, respectively. The largest measurement uncertainty in the aerosol optical depth (AOD) was found at the Lulin site, while that of the single-scattering albedo led to the largest errors in Wuhan and Xianghe. AOD, solar zenith angle (SZA), and single-scattering albedo contributed significantly more than the asymmetry factor, land surface albedo, precipitable water vapor, and ozone. This was especially true for AOD, which was higher than 28 % at all sites.

To this end, polyparameter linear free energy relationships (pp-LFERs) were employed, and poor prediction results were observed outside model applicability domain of pp-LFERs. In this study, we improved the applicability of ML methods by adopting a chemical-structure (CS) based approach. We used the prediction of adsorption of organic molecules on carbon-based adsorbents as an example. Our results show that this approach can fully differentiate the structural differences between any organic molecules, while providing significant information that is relevant to their interaction with the adsorbents. We compared two CS feature descriptors: 3D-coordination and simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES). We then built CS-ML models based on neural networks (NN) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB). They all outperformed pp-LFERs based models and are capable to accurately predict adsorption isotherm of isomers with similar physiochemical properties such as chiral molecules, even though they are trained with achiral molecules and racemates.

Incident diabetes was followed for 15 years. Six different machine-learning models were used to predict prevalent diabetes (n = 115). The variables with top importance were thereafter used to predict incident diabetes (n = 83). Results: Boosted regression trees performed best regarding prediction of prevalent diabetes (area under the ROC-curve = 0.70). Following removal of correlated contaminants, the addition of nine selected contaminants (Cd, Pb, Trans-nonachlor the phthalate MiBP, Hg, Ni, PCB126, PCB169 and PFOS) resulted in a significant improvement of 6.0 % of the ROC curve (from 0.66 to 0.72, p = 0.018) regarding incident diabetes (n = 51) compared with a baseline model including sex and BMI when the first 5 years of the follow-up was used. No such improvement in prediction was seen over 15 years follow-up. The single contaminant being most closely related to incident diabetes over 5 years was Nickel (odds ratio 1.44 for a SD change, 95 % CI 1.05–1.95, p = 0.022). Conclusion: This study supports the view that machine learning was useful in finding a mixture of important contaminants that improved prediction of incident diabetes. This improvement in prediction was seen only during the first 5 years of follow-up. © 2022",Diabetes; Environmental contaminants; Epidemiology; Machine learning; Mixtures,Article,Scopus

However, due to their sheer volume, it is impossible to explore all possible interactions by simply utilizing experimental methods. Herein, we used two model TMDC nanosheets, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and tungsten disulfide (WS2), and seven PFAS to explore their interactions and subsequent impacts on model cell lines and zebrafish. Utilizing experimental methods and machine learning approaches, we showed that TMDCs-PFAS interactions can pose unique challenges due to their interaction-specific toxicity niches towards cell lines. Further in vivo experiments, together with molecular dynamics simulation, suggested that TMDCs-PFAS interactions in aqueous environments significantly increased their bioaccumulation in zebrafish towards different target organs, mostly due to the differences in loading PFAS. Such enhanced bioaccumulation increased the oxidative stress in zebrafish liver and intestine, as demonstrated by the increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and other enzyme activities, which eventually led to obvious histopathological alterations in the liver and intestine.

However, there is still a lack of quantitative assessment and reconciling practice on the deviation. In this study, a total of 210 deviations were recompiled to thoroughly examine this issue. It was shown that up to 81 (39%) deviations exceeded the recommended ± 20% variation specification, highlighting that the deviation of MPs should not be neglected. This study attempted to reconcile the deviation based on the most prominent driving factors. Specifically, the game theory-based SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm identified that the particle size was the most important factor affecting the deviation. Subsequently, at each size magnitude, a significant linear correlation between the logarithmic actual and nominal concentrations was determined, which provided a sound basis for estimating the actual concentration from the nominal one. Furthermore, deviations of different size classes were simulated through 10, 000 points, suggesting that the ± 20% deviation variation could be well maintained within a specific concentration range. Moreover, the potential interaction effects between factors were quantified by SHAP interaction values, with more detailed conversion bases proposed. Additionally, several control measures were recommended to reduce the deviation of MPs. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Actual concentration; Aqueous solution; Deviation control; Microplastics; Nominal concentration,Article,Scopus

Considering that it is difficult to determine the Klip/w values of all pollutants through experiments, researchers gradually developed models to predict it. However, there is currently no research on how to comprehensively evaluate prediction models and recommend a compelling optimal modeling method. To remedy the defect of single parameters in a traditional model comparison, the TOPSIS evaluation method, based on entropy weight, was first proposed. We use this method to comprehensively evaluate models from multiple angles in this study. Thirty QSPR models, including 3 descriptor dimension reduction methods and 10 algorithms (belonging to 4 tribes), were used to predict Klip/w and verify the effectiveness of the comprehensive assessment method. The results showed that RF (descriptor dimension reduction method), symbolism (tribes) and RF (algorithm) exhibited significant advantages in establishing the Klip/w value prediction model.

HCN channels play a critical role in generating and sustaining synchronized neuronal firing and are involved in the actions of anaesthetics. However, the role of these channels in sleep-wakefulness per se has yet to be studied. We conducted polysomnographic recordings of Hcn1 constitutive knockout (Hcn1 KO) and wild-type (WT) mice in order to investigate the potential role of HCN1 channels in sleep/wake regulation. EEG and EMG data were analysed using the Somnivore™ machine learning algorithm. Time spent in each vigilance state, bout number and duration, and EEG power spectral activity were compared between genotypes. There were no significant differences in the time spent in wake, rapid eye movement (REM) or non-REM (NREM) sleep between Hcn1 KO and WT mice. Wake bout duration during the inactive phase was significantly shorter in Hcn1 KO mice whilst no other bout parameters were affected by genotype. Hcn1 KO mice showed a reduction in overall EEG power which was particularly prominent in the theta (5–9 Hz) and alpha (9–15 Hz) frequency bands and most evident during NREM sleep. Together these data suggest that HCN1 channels do not play a major role in sleep architecture or modulation of vigilance states. However, loss of these channels significantly alters underlying neuronal activity within these states which may have functional consequences. © 2022",EEG power spectrum; HCN1; Sleep; Wakefulness,Article,Scopus

In this study, we report data-driven, machine learning workflows to predict brittleness from less expensive, readily available conventional logs. We propose three strategies to predict brittleness using gamma ray, neutron porosity, density, caliper, sonic, and photoelectric factor logs by utilizing gradient boosting (GB), support vector regression (SVR), and neural networks (NN). The first strategy involves predicting brittleness directly from the logs while the second strategy predicts shear sonic logs used for the estimation of brittleness. The performance of the models given as R2 on deployment on the testing set for the first strategy is: GB (0.87), SVR (0.73), and NN (0.82), while for the second strategy: GB (0.94), SVR (0.87), and NN (0.94). In the third strategy, we convert the prediction into a classification task by grouping the brittleness estimate into ductile, transition, and brittle. The accuracy of model deployment on the testing set for the third strategy is: GB (89.37%), SVM (89.06%), and NN (89.16%). We demonstrate that depending on the strategy adopted, the gradient boosting algorithm outperforms the other peer algorithms in terms of training and validation scores. Furthermore, we combine the three algorithms using a committee machine to improve the performance of the model.

In recent years, various approaches have been made to developing a less complex and cost-effective process for diagnosing SLA patients, as opposed to using the inconvenient, complex and costly polysomnography test. This study proposed a novel approach of cascading two different types of Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) in Deep Belief Networks (DBN) method for the SLA classification using single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The proposed framework uses two types of RBM, namely Gaussian-Bernoulli, and Bernoulli-Bernoulli, which are modified forms of the Boltzmann Machine, to develop an enhanced- DBN (E-DBN) structure for significant feature learning and detection of SLA and normal events. At each ECG data signal, Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and ECG-Derived Respiration (EDR) signals are obtained from the 1-minute segmented ECG signal. The E-DBN model can also enhance the parameter detection performance as a key feature extractor and classification method. The Apnea-ECG datasets from physionet were used to train the presented fine-tuned E-DBN model and validate its performance for detecting SLA incidents.

Despite their recent debut, the scientific community has begun to place greater emphasis on them as alternatives to ionic liquids (ILs). Knowledge of the various physical properties of DESs is essential for various applications in the chemical industries and related fields. In this study, a comprehensive database including 1410 density data points, from 166 different DESs at various temperatures and atmospheric pressure, were retrieved from open literature to develop models to increase the accuracy of density predictions. The densities of DESs were used to develop two commonly used machine learning models, namely Multilayer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network (MLPANN) and Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM), in conjunction with the group contribution (GC) method. Based on the GC method, each fragment of a compound contributes a specific amount to the physical property's value. By considering this, the prediction ability was improved by applying the GC method in the model development procedure. Both models predict the DES densities by taking into account the effect of 35 functional groups, the temperature, and the HBA/HBD molar ratios. The optimum MLPANN model structure consists of a single hidden layer with five neurons and a logarithmic sigmoid transfer function. By employing this MLPANN-GC model, the values of the squared correlation coefficient, R2, and absolute average relative deviation percent, AARD%, were 0.99 and 0.61%, respectively, while for the LSSVM-GC model (with the radial basis function (RBF) kernel), they were 0.99 and 0.56%, respectively. Also, K-fold cross-validation was used to assess the performance of the LSSVM-GC model. The presented machine learning models in this study were found to perform more accurately than those obtained using the best current correlations and GC models for DES densities in the open literature. The more accurate results, in addition to the enhanced predictability behavior of the developed models, give these models a preference for use in industrial and academic applications. © 2022",Artificial neural network; Density; DES; Group contribution; Machine learning; Physical property; Support vector machine,Article,Scopus

However, it has been recognized that adaptive procedures are needed to force the neural network to fit accurately the stubborn spots in the solution of “stiff” PDEs. In this paper, we propose a fundamentally new way to train PINNs adaptively, where the adaptation weights are fully trainable and applied to each training point individually, so the neural network learns autonomously which regions of the solution are difficult and is forced to focus on them. The self-adaptation weights specify a soft multiplicative soft attention mask, which is reminiscent of similar mechanisms used in computer vision. The basic idea behind these SA-PINNs is to make the weights increase as the corresponding losses increase, which is accomplished by training the network to simultaneously minimize the losses and maximize the weights. In addition, we show how to build a continuous map of self-adaptive weights using Gaussian Process regression, which allows the use of stochastic gradient descent in problems where conventional gradient descent is not enough to produce accurate solutions. Finally, we derive the Neural Tangent Kernel matrix for SA-PINNs and use it to obtain a heuristic understanding of the effect of the self-adaptive weights on the dynamics of training in the limiting case of infinitely-wide PINNs, which suggests that SA-PINNs work by producing a smooth equalization of the eigenvalues of the NTK matrix corresponding to the different loss terms. In numerical experiments with several linear and nonlinear benchmark problems, the SA-PINN outperformed other state-of-the-art PINN algorithm in L2 error, while using a smaller number of training epochs. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Numerical methods for PDE; Physics-informed neural networks; Scientific machine learning,Article,Scopus

However, the high carbon footprint yielded by larger and larger DL networks has become a concern for sustainability. Furthermore, DL decision mechanism is somewhat obscure in that it can only be verified by test data. Green learning (GL) is being proposed as an alternative paradigm to address these concerns. GL is characterized by low carbon footprints, lightweight model, low computational complexity, and logical transparency. It offers energy-efficient solutions in cloud centers as well as mobile/edge devices. GL also provides a more transparent, logical decision-making process which is essential to gaining people's trust. Several statistical tools such as unsupervised representation learning, supervised feature learning, and supervised decision learning, have been developed to achieve this goal in recent years. We have seen a few successful GL examples with performance comparable with state-of-the-art DL solutions.

Moreover, fault detection techniques based on vibration signals are commonly applied to monitor the health of rotating machinery. However, the installation of vibration sensor is inconvenient, which will greatly affect collected signal and thus influence detection effect. This paper proposes a novel method with improved cyclic spectral covariance matrix (ICSCM) and motor current signal analysis, which achieves multi-sensor data fusion for rotating machinery fault detection. Firstly, an improved cyclic spectral is proposed to process multi-sensor signals collected from rotating machinery, which adaptively acquires multi-sensor mode components. Subsequently, sample entropy of acquired mode components is utilized to construct the ICSCM, which can fully preserve the interaction relationship between different sensors. Finally, ICSCM is incorporated into extreme learning machine classifier to identify different fault types for rotating machinery. The merits of the proposed method are validated using two datasets. Analysis results demonstrate that the proposed method has achieved satisfactory results and more reliable diagnosis accuracy than other state-of-the-art algorithms in rotating machinery fault detection. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Fault detection; Improved cyclic spectral covariance matrix; Motor current signal analysis; Multi-sensor data fusion; Rotating machinery,Article,Scopus

Herein, bamboo sawdust (BS) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) are selected to investigate the synergistic effects during co-pyrolysis via photoionization mass spectrometry (PI-MS). Based on the statistical analysis, for enhancing the synergetic effects of co-pyrolysis, the suitable LDPE/BS ratio should be at least 1:1. During the co-pyrolysis, LDPE promotes the conversion of BS-derivatives to low molecular weight oxygenated compounds (e.g., furfurals and simple phenolic compounds), while the decomposition of LDPE could also be enhanced by BS pyrolysis products. The synergetic effect of LDPE and lignin is more notable than that of LDPE and cellulose or hemicellulose. Meanwhile, for overcoming the drawback of PI-MS analysis in obtaining quantitative information, the RF (Random Forest) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) algorithms are successfully used to predict the TG curves of BS/LDPE mixtures via the temperature-evolved profiles of representative products.

Variation in energy usage is observed with weather conditions, as space conditioning needs to change seasonally, and with production, energy-using equipment is directly tied to production rate. Previous models were based on engineering analyses of equipment and relied on site-specific details. Others consisted of single-variable regressors that did not capture all contributions to energy consumption. New modeling techniques could be applied to rectify these weaknesses. Applying data from 45 different manufacturing plants obtained from industrial energy audits, a supervised machine-learning model is developed to create a general predictor for industrial building energy consumption. The model uses features of air enthalpy, solar radiation, and wind speed to predict weather-dependency; motor, steam, and compressed air system parameters to capture support equipment contributions; and operating schedule, production rate, number of employees, and floor area to determine production-dependency. Results showed that a model that used a linear regressor over a transformed feature space could outperform a support vector machine and utilize features more representative of physical systems.

Here, we construct models to detect suicidality in MDD using machine learning (ML) and whole-brain functional connectivity (FC). Methods: A cross-sectional assessment was conducted on 200 subjects, including 126 MDD with high suicide risk (HSR; 73 patients with suicidal ideation [SI], 53 patients with suicidal attempts [SA]), 36 patients with low suicide risk (LSR) and 38 healthy controls (HCs). Whole-brain FC features were calculated, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was used for feature selection. A support vector machine (SVM) was performed to build models to distinguish MDD from HCs, and for suicide risk stratification among MDD. Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was performed for validation. Results: The models constructed using SVM on whole-brain FC had powerful classification efficiency in screening MDD from HCs (accuracy = 88.50 %), and in suicide risk stratification among MDD patients (with accuracy = 84.56 % and 74.60 % in classifying patients with HSR or LSR, and SA or SI, respectively). Subsequent analysis demonstrated that intra-network dysconnectivity in the sensorimotor network and inter-network dysconnectivity between the default and dorsal attention network could characterize HSR and SA in MDD, separately. Limitations: This study was a single center cohort study without external validation.

According to the optimal method and net ecosystem production (NEP) model, we quantitatively explored vegetation carbon sources and sinks in Central Asia from 1990 to 2020, and then the effect of the desertification process on them was quantified under different aridity stress. The results showed that GTB method performs best on the test set and spatial pattern, which has higher overall accuracy (82.1 %) and Kappa coefficient (0.78) than other five methods. The desertification area has decreased by 8.58 % (341,643 km2) from 1990 to 2020. Among them, the severe and slight desertification areas decreased by 62.42 % and 32.11 %, respectively, while the moderate and high desertification areas increased by 24.6 % and 13.11 %, respectively. In particular, land restoration areas where the desertification restored one or above levels, accounted for 33.91 % of the total area.

However, these powerful platforms are still a major academic curiosity, without their acceptance and implementation by industry. One of the major obstacles is the absence of models to predict the partition of biomolecules in ATPS in an easy and predictive way. To address this limitation, modelling studies on the binodal curve behavior of polymer-electrolyte ATPS and the partitioning of biomolecules in these aqueous electrolyte solutions are carried out in this work. First, a comprehensive database targeting the studied systems is established. In total, 11,998 experimental binodal data points covering 276 polymer-electrolyte ATPS at different temperatures (273.15 K-399.15 K) and 626 experimental partition data points involving 22 biomolecules in 42 polymer-electrolyte ATPS at different temperatures (283.15 K-333.15 K) are included. Then, a novel modeling strategy that combines a well-known machine learning algorithm, i.e., artificial neural network (ANN) and group contribution (GC) method is proposed. Based on this modeling strategy, an ANN-GC model (ANN-GC model1) is built to describe the binodal curve behavior of polymer-electrolyte ATPS, while another ANN-GC model (ANN-GC model2) is developed to predict the partition of biomolecules in these biphasic systems. ANN-GC model1 gives a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0132 and squared correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.9878 for the 9,598 training data points, and for the 1,200 validation data points they are 0.0141 and 0.9858, respectively. Meanwhile, it also gives a MAE of 0.0143 and R2 of 0.9846 for the 1,200 test data points. On the other hand, ANN-GC model2 gives root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.0577 for 501 training data points, and for the 62 validation data points and 63 test data points their RMSD are 0.0849 and 0.0885, respectively. Furthermore, the obtained results also indicate that the tie-line length of polymer-electrolyte ATPS calculated from ANN-GC model1 can be directly used in ANN-GC model2 for predicting the partition performance coefficient of biomolecules in these ATPS. The developed models offer the possibility to predict the partition of biomolecules in ATPS without any requirement of experimental data. Based on the developed ANN-GC models, some high-performance ATPS are identified to partition four well-known biomolecules. © 2022 The Author(s)",Aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS); Artificial neural network; Biomolecule separation and purification; Electrolytes; Modeling,Article,Scopus

A Kanthal D wire of standard wire gauge 36 is used. The data set is divided into three classes: no boiling, nucleate boiling, and critical heat flux to identify the boiling incipience and critical heat flux. Much focus is insisted on identifying critical heat flux as it carries more practical importance in the safety of the cooling systems. Data set size optimization is performed to find the lowest number of records required for each method. Three machine-learning methods are employed to predict the boiling regime, namely, binary decision tree method, decision tree ensemble method and naive Bayes method. Out of these, the decision tree ensemble outperformed the binary decision tree and naive Bayes classifiers. The decision tree ensemble classified the regimes in the given data with the lowest classification error and inference time.

To a great extent, the models are plagued by imperfect closures on higher order turbulence quantities with strongly varying thermal physical properties. This paper reports on an alternative approach to model the turbulent heat transfer at supercritical pressure, including the direct turbulent production models and the indirect transport closures using deep neural networks (DNN). This paper presents a method of modifying turbulence models of supercritical pressure fluid from high-fidelity simulation (DNS) data. An iterative DNS-DNN-RANS framework is proposed to establish explicit closures for turbulent momentum diffusion and turbulent thermal diffusion of turbulent heat transfer at supercritical pressure. Priori physics knowledge, feature engineering strategy and establish existing constitutive theory are involved to embed the special characteristics of supercritical pressure fluid into the turbulent closures to establish a proper regression system for machine learning (ML) algorithm. By embedding the explicit ML models, the low Reynolds number k-? model was modified and was trained under a cross-case strategy with abundant DNS data. The modified model was successfully validated against DNS and experimental data for upward pipe flows, in which wall temperature were satisfactorily reproduced. The posterior simulations showed that the modified ML-KTVT model not only has a good performance in predicting the convection heat transfer of supercritical pressure fluid but also performs a favorable reproducibility of turbulence development in heat transfer deterioration cases. © 2022",Machine learning; Supercritical pressure; Turbulence modeling,Article,Scopus

These are thought to form from explosive jets of carbon dioxide gas breaking through the thawing seasonal ice cap, carrying dust and dirt which is then deposited onto the ice as dark ‘blotches’, or blown by the surface winds into streaks or ‘fans’. We investigate machine learning (ML) methods for automatically identifying these seasonal features in High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) satellite imagery. We designed deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that were trained and tested using the catalog generated by Planet Four, an online citizen science project mapping the south polar seasonal deposits. We validated the CNNs by comparing their results with those of ISODATA (Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique) clustering and as expected, the CNNs were significantly better at predicting the results found by Planet Four, in both the area of predicted seasonal deposits and in delineating their boundaries. We found neither the CNNs or ISODATA were suited to predicting the source point and directions of seasonal fans, which is a strength of the citizen science approach. The CNNs showed good agreement with Planet Four in cross-validation metrics and detected some seasonal deposits in the HiRISE images missed in the Planet Four catalog; the total area of seasonal deposits predicted by the CNNs was 27% larger than that of the Planet Four catalog, but this aspect varied considerably on a per-image basis. © 2022 The Author(s)",Classification; Machine learning; Mars; Surface,Article,Scopus

However, traditional machine vision algorithms have low reusability and their development processes are often expensive and time consuming. Several deep learning-based bearing surface defect detection methods have been proposed. However, these deep learning models often require a large number of datasets, which is often difficult to achieve in the actual industry. Transfer learning provides a promising solution to the small sample difficulties associated with deep learning. However, the complexity of the illumination conditions and the huge differences between bearing dataset and ImageNet dataset make it impossible to use the current single model-based transfer learning for bearing defect detection. In this study, we propose a novel transitive transfer learning convolutional neural network (CNN) ensemble framework for classifying bearing surface defects. Only small-scale datasets are needed in this framework. A transfer path and transfer method selection strategy for transitive transfer learning is then proposed to train the deep learning models, which enhances the feature extraction ability of the CNN models on the basis of multiple illuminations. Ablation experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed transitive transfer learning CNN ensemble framework has the accuracy rate of 97.51%.

However, these methods cannot model the long-range dependencies between the fused image and the source images. To address this limitation, we propose DFENet, a multimodal medical image fusion framework that integrates CNN feature learning and vision transformer feature learning using self-supervised learning. DFENet is based on an encoder-decoder network, which can be trained on large-scale natural image dataset without the need for carefully collated ground truth fusion images. The proposed network consists of an encoder, a feature fuser, and a decoder. The encoder is composed of a CNN module and a transformer module, which is used to extract local and global features of images. In order to avoid the use of simple up-sampling and concatenate processing, a new global semantic information aggregation module is proposed to efficiently aggregate the multi-scale features obtained by the transformer module, which enhances the quality of the reconstructed images. The decoder is composed of six convolution layers with two skip connections, which are used for the reconstruction from fused features. We also propose a fusion strategy combining local energy and gradient information for the feature fusion process of magnetic resonance imaging and functional medical images. Compared to conventional fusion rules, our fusion strategy is more robust to noisy images. And compared with the existing competitive methods, our method retains more texture details of the original images and outputs a more natural and realistic fused image. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Convolutional neural network; Feature fuser; Local energy and gradient; Multimodal medical image fusion; Vision transformer,Article,Scopus

Previous work has shown that it is usually non-intuitive, and it frequently employs Electroencephalogram (EEG) based motor imagery. Ensemble learning has been shown to be reliable in a variety of BCI classification tasks, including motor imagery and P300 event-related potential. The purpose of ensemble learning, according to past research, is to get trained accurate but diverse base classifiers to increase generalization performance. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) with fast learning speed has been proven effective in classification applications and suitable for ensemble learning due to its randomness. The suitability of ensemble methods for intuitive BCI communication using EEG data of different covert speech words is investigated in this work. Methods: To achieve this goal, we construct a random rotation based kernel ELM ensemble, resulting in very diverse classifiers which can learn through transformed spaces. Minimize error ensemble pruning is used to prune low complementarity classifiers, and consequently, combining the remaining high complementarity classifiers to get the final ensemble classifier. Eight subjects performed covert speech tasks which involved mentally repeating five words namely; ‘left’, ‘right’, ‘up’, ‘down’, and ‘stop’. Results: We achieved classification accuracy with pruning and without pruning of 63.67% and 57.13% respectively.

Here, this study firstly applied machine learning to study the effects of pore structure, chemical properties, and adsorption conditions on CO2 adsorption performance based on 1594 CO2 adsorption datasets, and to predict CO2 adsorption capacity. The results show that the R2 of the random forest (RF) model is above 0.97 on the training and test data, which has good prediction performance. According to RF analysis results, the nitrogen groups of porous carbon have the greatest impact on CO2 capture at 0–0.15 bar, while ultra-micropores have the greatest impact on CO2 capture at 0.15–1 bar. Subsequently, we prepared three kinds of porous carbons with different pore structures and functional groups, and carried out CO2 adsorption isotherm tests. The results were consistent with the results of machine learning. However, the above results hardly reveal the effect of functional group type and pore size on CO2 capture. Finally, the relative importance of pore size and functional group on CO2 adsorption under different pressures was calculated by molecular simulation, and the mechanism of CO2 adsorption by a single pore size and functional group species was revealed.

The controlling of soil heavy metal is mainly focused on the emission source and pipe-end treatment, less is known about the intermediate controlling process. The migration route of heavy metals exhibited the spatial evolution of pollutants from the sources to the pipe-end, which provided the more reasonable location for the target-oriented treatment of soil heavy metal. Here, we proposed a new view of heavy metal similarity, which quantitatively expressed how closely of the contaminations between the study area and the test areas. We found that the similarity of different heavy metals was unequally distributed across locations that were related with five main sources, namely agricultural activities, natural sources, traffic emissions, industrial activities, and other sources. Based on the similarity, a state-of-the-art machine learning method was applied to delineate the migration route of soil heavy metals. Thereinto, As was concentrated around livestock farms, and its migration route was close to the water system. Cd migration route was over-dispersed in the areas where located mine fields and chemical plants.

In this paper, a residual denoising dynamic adaptation network (RDDAN) is proposed, which uses the signal knowledge under known working conditions to diagnose rolling bearing faults under unknown working conditions. The method mainly consists of data preprocessing, feature extraction, and dynamic distribution adaptation. First, Gaussian noise is added at the data preprocessing stage to emulate the noise perturbation during the reality of rolling bearing operation. Secondly, a deep residual shrinkage network is used for noise reduction and feature extraction. Finally, the marginal probability distribution and conditional probability distribution under different working conditions are calculated, depending on the characteristics. The network is disciplined using the relative weight of the marginal probability distribution and the conditional probability distribution. And the fault classification results are output after multiple iterations. The method was tested on the Case Western Reserve University bearing dataset and the Machine Fault Simulator Magnum bearing dataset, respectively. In comparison with other models, the RDDAN improves the average accuracy by about 23%.

This study aimed to construct prediction models of disability risk for geriatric patients with hypertension at different time intervals, as well as to assess the important predictors and influencing factors of disability. Methods: This study collected data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity and Happy Family Study. There were 1576, 1083 and 506 hypertension patients aged 65+ in 2008 who were free of disability at baseline and had completed outcome information in follow-up of 2008-2012, 2008-2014, 2008-2018. We built five machine learning (ML) models to predict the disability risk. The classic statistical logistic regression (classic-LR) and shapley additive explanations (SHAP) was further introduced to explore possible causal factors and interpret the optimal models’ decisions. Results: Among the five ML models, logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting, and deep neural network were the optimal models for detecting 4-, 6-, and 10-year disability risk with their AUC-ROCs reached 0.759, 0.728, 0.694 respectively. The classic-LR revealed potential casual factors for disability and the results of SHAP demonstrated important features for risk prediction, reinforcing the trust of decision makers towards black-box models. Conclusion: The optimal models hold promise for screening out hypertensive old adults at high risk of disability to implement further targeted intervention and the identified key factors may be of additional value in analyzing the causal mechanisms of disability, thereby providing basis to practical application. © 2022",Disability; Elderly; Hypertension; Interpretability; Machine learning,Article,Scopus

Many log-based anomaly detection methods have been proposed. Due to the variety and unstructured characteristics of logs, log parsing is the first necessary step for parsing logs into structured ones in log-based anomaly detection methods. Prior studies have found that the effectiveness of log parsing will impact the performance of log-based anomaly detection. However, few studies comprehensively investigate whether better log parsing implies better anomaly detection. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensively empirical study to investigate the impact of six state-of-the-art log parsers belonging to four categories (including heuristic-based, frequency-based, clustering-based, and subsequence-based) on six state-of-the-art log-based anomaly detection methods (including machine-learning-based and deep-learning-based methods). Experimental results on three public datasets show that (1) High parsing accuracy does not definitely imply high anomaly detection performance. Both parsing accuracy and the number of parsed event templates should be considered when choosing log parsers for anomaly detection. (2) The log parsers have an impact on the efficiency of anomaly detection methods. With the increase in the number of parsed event templates, the efficiency of anomaly detection decreases. In detail, the heuristic-based parsers have less impact on the efficiency of anomaly detection methods, followed by frequency-based parsers. (3) All the anomaly detection methods perform more effectively and efficiently with the heuristic-based log parsers. Thus, the heuristic-based log parsers are recommended for a new practitioner on anomaly detection. We believe that our work, with the evaluation results and the corresponding findings, can help researchers and practitioners better understand the impact of log parsers on anomaly detection and provide guidelines for choosing a suitable log parser for their anomaly detection method. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Anomaly detection; Empirical study; Log parser,Article,Scopus

Most forms of gambling, and most notably slot machine play, follow a random ratio (RR) schedule of reinforcement that should lead to rapid and extinction-resistant behaviour. In this paper we highlight the caveats that need to be applied when generalising animal models of learning to human behaviour. Studies need to be cognisant of the role of verbal rules and cognitive appraisals of contingency; the ability for participants to self-modify important elements of reward schedules; potential differences between concurrent and longitudinal schedule preferences; and, the role of important human motivations in financial decision-making. In particular, we believe that operant approaches to gambling may need to incorporate a greater focus on FOMO (or the fear of missing out) as a motivational construct that may explain some of the observed patterns of behaviour, including riskier behaviours, on slot games.

To learn more information from the limited samples, we previously proposed a method of contrastive embedding learning to incorporate additional out-of-class information into the model. However, since the method mapped each entire sample to a deep embedding vector and modelled the distribution of the embeddings, it hardly learned the detailed information within the samples. In fact, a sample is a finite combination of various components, and the classification task essentially is to detect the presence of components that contain adventitious sounds, where detailed component-wise information is crucial. To this end, a method of patch-level contrastive embedding learning based on finer-grained patches is further proposed in this paper. It divides each sample into multiple patches and maps the patches to the embedding space. The patches are split into different subclasses, according to the type of adventitious sounds contained in each patch. Considering that there might be no patch-level labels provided in most cases, a Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) based approach is designed to estimate the labels. Then by modelling intra- and inter-subclass distance between the patch-level embeddings, the method learns the detailed information about the difference between patches, which benefits the identification task. The results following random and official splitting on the ICBHI dataset show that our method achieves the performance of 79.99% and 52.95%, exceeding the previous one by 1.81% and 1.58%, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Adventitious sound; Contrastive learning; Patch-level method; Respiratory sound classification,Article,Scopus

Before fracking there is a lengthy period of preparation, which can represent a significant proportion of the well lifecycle. Extensive infrastructure is delivered onto site, leading to increased volumes of heavy traffic, energy generation and construction work on site. Termed the “pre-operational” period, this is rarely investigated as air quality evaluations typically focus on the extraction phase. In this work we quantify the change in air pollution during pre-operational activities at a shale gas exploration site near Kirby Misperton, North Yorkshire, England. Baseline air quality measurements were made two years prior to any shale gas activity and were used as a training dataset for random forest (RF) machine learning models. The models allowed for a comparison between observed air quality during the pre-operational phase and a counterfactual business as usual (BAU) prediction. During the pre-operational phase a significant deviation from the BAU scenario was observed. This was characterised by significant enhancements in NOx and a concurrent reduction in O3, caused by extensive additional vehicle movements and the presence of combustion sources such as generators on the well pad. During the pre-operational period NOx increased by 274 % and O3 decreased by 29 % when compared to BAU model values. There was also an increase in primary emissions of NO2 during the pre-operational phase which may have implications for the attainment of ambient air quality standards in the local surroundings. Unconventional O&amp;G development remains under discussion as a potential option for improving the security of supply of domestic energy, tensioned however against significant environmental impacts. Here we demonstrate that the preparative work needed to begin fracking elevates air pollution in its own right, a further potential disbenefit that should be considered. © 2022 The Author(s)",Baseline monitoring; Fracking; Machine learning; NOx; Oil and gas emissions; Random Forest,Article,Scopus

To this end, a consolidated database with 1440 data points from 18 sources is compiled.

Using the column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2) data of SCIAMACHY, GOSAT, and OCO-2, we derived monthly-scale contiguous XCO2 data across China from 2003 to 2019 with 0.25° resolution. The results showed a good agreement with the satellite measurements, with the bias and standard deviation of 0.11 and 1.38 ppmv for the validation dataset, respectively. Moreover, the results were consistent with the model simulation and in-situ sites, indicating the ability to reflect long-term spatio-temporal variation with a finer texture. We analyzed the spatial distribution, seasonal variation, and long-term trends of XCO2 in China, revealing that the machine learning method has comparable performance to model simulations. The results showed that XCO2 is dominated by anthropogenic emissions spatially and has a clear seasonal cycle, with a larger amplitude the further north. The long-term trend shows the XCO2 increased by an average rate of 2.17 ppmv per year from 2003 to 2019 in China, which is consistent with the global. The method and data can further study the carbon cycle and climate change. © 2022",CO2; GOSAT satellite; Machine learning; OCO-2 satellite; Remote sensing; SCIAMACHY satellite,Article,Scopus

But the early detection and removal of polyps can reduce the death rate to a considerable extent. The various stages of colon cancer using the YOLOv3 Multi-Scale Framework (YOLOv3-MSF) have been studied here in this context. Colonoscopy is an examination method to detect changes in the rectum by inserting a long flexible tube into the rectum. For screening colon cancer, gastroenterologist often refers to the pathological images of colonoscopy for diagnosis. In recent decades, various machine learning algorithms are used for diagnosis to get practical and reliable results. More often, the stages of colon cancer can be inspected by the Tumor Length (TL). In this study, the polyps are segmented and allowed to measure the TL value by assessing polyp length (Plen) and polyp width (Pwid). The various stages of colon cancer have been ascertained based on the maximum length between the Plen and Pwid. Our research uses the single-stage YOLOv3 object detection model to locate and classify the various stages based on the TL value. It outputs the class probability and position coordinates of each image by enhancing accuracy and robustness. At the outset, during preprocessing to address the specific problems like reduced contrast, blurred images and noisy data, the proposed model defines a data augmentation with a jitter value of 0.3 to avoid overfitting. Next, for detecting and annotating various stages of colon cancer, YOLOv3-MSF deep learning architecture with multiscale detection layers used here. By adopting transfer learning, we used YOLOv3 in our work. It chooses the anchor boxes using the K-Medoids algorithm during object detection in the training stage based on the ResNet network structure of YOLOv3. Finally, additional layers such as fully connected layer are embedded into the existing architecture. we used the CVC colonDB database to train and evaluate the fully connected layer during experiments. To analyze the performance of the proposed system, we compare our model with the state of art object detection model. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms existing systems on peak to accuracy, precision rate, recall rate, and f-measures. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",,Article,Scopus

Due to its mass storage in warehouses, tonnes of wheat grains rotten every year that eventually affects its market price. This paper presents an end-to-end automatic system that utilizes computer vision techniques for the quality grading of wheat grains. The main purpose of this work is to determine most discriminatory features and a suitable classifier that may classify the given wheat sample into two classes ‘fresh’ and ‘rotten’. At first, shadow removal, segmentation, and separation of each grain is performed as parts of the pre-processing step. The pre-processing is followed by the features extraction step where 7 color and 16 texture handcrafted features are determined for each grain. The four binary classification models, namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Naïve Bayes (NB) are then built using 10-fold cross validation approach. The classifiers are compared on the basis of performance metrics- accuracy, error rate, recall, specificity, precision, and F1-score. The comparative analysis depicts that based on color features, the SVM classifier outperforms other classifiers by achieving the accuracy of 93%. In contrast, based on texture features, the NB classifier achieved accuracy at 65%; highest among all classifiers. Experimental results encourage the utility of SVM classifier modelled on color features in automatic quality grading of wheat grains. © 2022",Agriculture; Classification; Computer vision; Features extraction; Machine learning; Wheat,Article,Scopus

The degree of dependency between skin temperature and subcutaneous blood perfusion in the PORH test, however, remains an unsettled subject. The purpose of this study is to evaluate their correlations and explore the prospects of restoring subcutaneous blood perfusion using skin temperature readings. 10 volunteers participated the experimental study of PORH test, and subcutaneous blood perfusion and skin temperature images of hand were captured by laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) and infrared (IR) camera respectively. Wavelet cross-correlation (WCC) analysis of extracted LSCI and IR signals in the resting phase of PORH test revealed that as frequency increased within 0.005 ? 0.1 Hz, the modules of WCC reduced and phase shift increased. Based on phase shift characteristics, the distances of thermal wave propagation were estimated 0.9 mm ? 2.3 mm, which were basically consistent with the measurement depth of LSCI. We further demonstrated that when the frequency-dependent delay and attenuation were taken into account, the correlation of oscillations between LSCI and IR signals improved significantly. Finally, an algorithm was proposed to reconstruct IR signals, which could be used to improve the possibilities of restoring subcutaneous blood perfusion from skin temperature recordings in PORH tests.

IoT is implemented using the ThingSpeak platform, which enables the visualization and analysed the ECG data over the cloud server. Using ThingSpeak, encrypted and authenticated ECG data is shared with cardiologist for examination. To validate the proposed classification method, the standard annotated dataset of the MIT-BIH database is tested and various performance metrics were calculated.

In this study, impact sensitivity experiments were used to induce emotions such as fear and tension in participants, thus causing them to develop mental load. Prospective time-distance estimation tests and subjective questionnaires were used to validate the induction experiment. EEG signals from three brain regions and eye movements of the subjects made up four single variables, and combinations of different brain regions and eye movements were used as combined variables. Thus, a total of 15 variables were used for the analysis of mental load states. The Relief algorithm was applied to the 15 variables for feature extraction to construct an optimized feature set. Then, 4 types of classifiers were used to identify mental load states. The combination of occipital area and eye movement variables achieved better mental load assessment results than single variables. With this combination variable, the SVM (94.9 %) and RF (94.3 %) classifiers were effective. However, the SVM classification accuracy gradually increased with the number of training sessions, while the RF classifier did not show this trend.

Seven machine learning (ML) models: multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Logistic Regression, Adaboost and Extra Tree classifier are used to classify emotional state. Two public datasets, DREAMER and SWELL are used for evaluation. The results show that no particular ML works best for all data.

Thus, precise detection of leukemia highly relies on accurate segmentation of leukocytes from blood smear images.

Such models have also shown superior results compared to traditional machine learning algorithms. This work represents a deep learning-based encoder–decoder model that focuses on salient multiscale leukocyte features. It is accomplished by combining features derived from standard and dilated convolutions. Using a convolutional block attention module (CBAM) in the network facilitates the extraction of refined features. We evaluated the performance of the proposed approach by conducting ablation studies on three publicly available datasets: ALL_IDB1, CellaVision and LISC. The first study is conducted to finalize the architecture of the dilated encoder path. In the subsequent study, a series of experiments are performed to obtain the most effective attention module. The last set of experiments deals with only a single encoder path that encapsulates dilated convolutions’ importance.

Patients with one of the listed malignancies must undergo therapy as soon as possible to prevent the progress of the disease and to avoid further bone damage to preserve a better quality of life. Classification of patients into low or high-risk groups is an important step in diagnosing a disorder, which led biomedical and bioinformatics research teams to investigate the usage of machine learning (ML) technologies. In this paper, ML techniques are adapted to a public lumbar spine dataset to detect vertebral fractures. First, the dataset was preprocessed by using the contour-based hybrid median filter with histogram equalization. Then the Mask LSTM-based R.O.I. segmentation techniques are applied to segment the spinal images. Finally, the suggested stacked Adaptive Enhanced AdaBoost (AE-AdB) gets trained on whole images to enhance the accuracy of the data classification.

Two of the main challenges are that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of graph Laplacians associated with directed graphs are in general complex-valued and that there is no universally accepted definition of clusters in directed graphs. We first exploit relationships between the graph Laplacian and transfer operators and in particular between clusters in undirected graphs and metastable sets in stochastic dynamical systems and then use a generalization of the notion of metastability to derive clustering algorithms for directed and time-evolving graphs. The resulting clusters can be interpreted as coherent sets, which play an important role in the analysis of transport and mixing processes in fluid flows. © 2022, The Author(s).",Coherent sets; Spectral clustering; Transfer operators,Article,Scopus

The difficulty also originates from the computational cost of ab initio methods for describing the potential energy surface. Recently, machine learning techniques have been widely utilized to accelerate materials discovery and molecular simulation. Compared to the commonly used artificial neural network, graph network is naturally suitable for clusters with flexible geometric environment of each atom. Herein we develop a cluster graph attention network (CGANet) by aggregating information of neighboring vertices and edges using attention mechanism, which can precisely predict the binding energy and force of silver clusters with root mean square error of 5.4 meV/atom and mean absolute error of 42.3 meV/Å, respectively. As a proof-of-concept, we have performed global optimization of medium-sized Agn clusters (n = 14?26) by combining CGANet and genetic algorithm. The reported ground-state structures for n = 14?21, have been successfully reproduced, while entirely new lowest-energy structures are obtained for n = 22?26. In addition to the description of potential energy surface, the CGANet is also applied to predict the electronic properties of clusters, such as HOMO energy and HOMO-LUMO gap. With accuracy comparable to ab initio methods and acceleration by at least two orders of magnitude, CGANet holds great promise in global search of lowest-energy structures of large clusters and inverse design of functional clusters.

Gasoline is the most extensively used fuel for the light-duty automobiles and passenger cars. Research octane number (RON), among other auto ignition related properties, is a primary indicator of the grade of the light-duty automobile fuels. Because measuring the RON is expensive and time-consuming, an alternative cost-effective grading method for engines is desired, for example, methods that in corporate machine learning. However, the physicochemical properties of the constituents of gasoline have a notable nonlinear relationship with the RON of the fuel. The accurate blending and production of commercial spark ignition engine fuels is limited by the lack of precise predictive models for RON. In this study, we developed a high-throughput method that accounts for the properties of gasoline and uses the Random Forest (RF) algorithm to predict the RON of gasoline. The maximum error of the RF model in RON prediction was 0.46, which was close to the range of experimental uncertainty.

PTB can cause new-born deaths and long term diseases of children. The objective of this work is to propose a novel machine learning approach to predict PTB from cervical electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of pregnant women during 20 to 22 weeks of pregnancy. Methods: The proposed approach selects a best EIS spectrum using a filter, then, predicts PTB based on the selected EIS spectrum using a predictor. A methodology is proposed to train a polynomial feature based logistic regression (PFLR) and a polynomial feature based random forest (PFRF) as filters or predictors, respectively, from an imbalanced high dimensional EIS dataset. A rough set-based genetic algorithm for selecting optimal polynomial feature subsets, a pre-processing step in the proposed methodology, is proposed. Results: For an EIS dataset of 438 patients of various demographics, previous obstetric and treatment history, PFRF achieves an average test set AUC 0.76 and PFLR achieves an average test set AUC 0.74. For the 365 patients who received no treatment interventions during pregnancy, PFRF achieves an average test set AUC 0.8 and PFLR achieves an average test set AUC 0.79. The proposed approach has outperformed the existing PTB prediction approaches based on EIS, demographics, previous obstetric history, TVUS CL, and FFN and RBF kernel SVM, MLPs (1-hidden-layer, 2-hidden-layers and 3-hidden-layers), XGBoost, logistic regression and random forest.

Most existing intelligent fault diagnosis approaches of bevel gearboxes are designed with vibration monitoring. However, the collected vibration data are vulnerable to noise pollution and machinery operating conditions. Besides, traditional fault diagnosis models highly rely on numerous labeled samples, and neglect the high cost of label annotation in real-world applications. Therefore, a novel fault diagnosis approach based on semi-supervised probability support matrix machine (SPSMM) and infrared imaging is proposed for bevel gearboxes in this paper, which has the following properties. Firstly, SPSMM classifies 2D matrix data directly without vectorization, thus fully utilizing the spatial information in infrared images. Secondly, a probability output strategy is designed for SPSMM to calculate the posterior class probability estimation of matrix inputs, and consequently enhance the diagnostic accuracy and robustness of the model. Thirdly, a semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework is proposed for SPSMM to carry out sample transfer from the unlabeled sample pool to the labeled sample pool, which can effectively alleviate the problem of insufficient labeled samples.

However, the applications of this technology is obstructed by the low activity and selectivity due to the inert of CO2 and favored hydrogen evolution reaction. Development of robust catalysts is the most feasible method to decrease the overpotential and suppress the competitive side reaction. Single-atom-catalysts (SACs) is one of the most promising catalysts with the satisfied activity. However, the clear and popular rules are still absence to explore the SACs with the desired properties due to the complicated items related with the overall performance. The suitable transition metals (TMs) are screened out based on the defective g-C3N4 (VN-C3N4) supporter by the first principle. Among 24 screened transition metals, the Ni-VN-C3N4 exhibits the better performance as compared to others. Later, the machine learning (ML) algorithm builds a bridge between catalytic activity and intrinsic structural and atomic features. Then, the same coordination environment is constructed on the graphene to explore the possibility to replace the VN-C3N4 with other carbon substrate.

ECG signal based automatic heartbeat classification is a critical task for arrhythmia detection and continues to be challenging.

Besides, the performance of previous work drops sharply when dealing with imbalanced datasets and lacks interpretability. Methods: This paper proposes a novel, explainable attention-based temporal convolutional network(TCN) heartbeat classification method. The first contribution of our approach is that we fuse the TCN architecture and self-attention mechanism to encode the ECG heartbeat sequences. Specifically, TCN and the self-attention block are designed to capture global variation tends and local features, respectively, to best serve the classification. Meanwhile, multi-class focal loss helps model training overcome the class imbalance problem.

Towards improving the performance of one dimensional interfacial area transport equation, along with many of the existing studies on developing sophisticated source and sink constitutive models describing the liquid-bubble and bubble-bubble interactions, additional efforts should be made on improving the accuracies of the closure models supporting the calculation of these constitutive models. In this study, a physics-informed machine learning method was proposed that couples the machine learning and the IATE model for improving the performance of the existing IATE models.

The machine learning model is guided by the physical models, and its training is through an IATE model-based loss optimization. To effectively train the machine learning model, a data augmentation method was developed based on the existing IAC database.

The present study aimed to explore the after damming transformation of wetland's eco-hydrological status and water quality and assessed its effects on livelihood vulnerability state of the fishermen community in the lower part of the Tangon river basin. Based on 15 field and satellite image-driven indicators of transformation, multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms were used to model the eco-hydrological state (EHS) of the wetland. Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) of 45 fishing-dominated villages was computed using a balanced weighted LVI score. The result revealed that 60.55 % wetland area was obliterated between the pre- dam and post-dam periods, and the existing wetland area (21.06 km2) witnessed noticeable eco-hydrological and water quality degradation. Correlation and kernel density estimation (KDE) plot clearly revealed that rate of EHS degradation and water quality changes was negatively associated (at ?0.01 level of significance) and both controlled LVI. So, such changes not only pose pressure on the aquatic species like fishes but also hampered the well-being of the fishermen communities evolving. The findings of the work would be useful in this transition while deciding the alternative strategies to build a resilient community. Moreover, since the eco-hydrological state were explored this would be effective for wetland restoration planning. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Eco-hydrological degradation; Fishermen community and impacts on fishermen; Livelihood vulnerability; Water quality; Wetland transformation,Article,Scopus

The study aims to examine the effect of air pollution on patient's hospital visits for respiratory diseases, particularly Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI). Outpatient hospital visits, air pollution and meteorological parameters were collected from March 2018 to October 2021. Eight machine learning algorithms (Random Forest model, K-Nearest Neighbors regression model, Linear regression model, LASSO regression model, Decision Tree Regressor, Support Vector Regression, X.G. Boost and Deep Neural Network with 5-layers) were applied for the analysis of daily air pollutants and outpatient visits for ARI. The evaluation was done by using 5-cross-fold confirmations. The data was randomly divided into test and training data sets at a scale of 1:2, respectively. Results show that among the studied eight machine learning models, the Random Forest model has given the best performance with R2 = 0.606, 0.608 without lag and 1-day lag respectively on ARI patients and R2 = 0.872, 0.871 without lag and 1-day lag respectively on total patients. All eight models did not perform well with the lag effect on the ARI patient dataset but performed better on the total patient dataset. Thus, the study did not find any significant association between ARI patients and ambient air pollution due to the intermittent availability of data during the COVID-19 period. This study gives insight into developing machine learning programs for risk prediction that can be used to predict analytics for several other diseases apart from ARI, such as heart disease and other respiratory diseases. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Air pollution; ARI; Machine learning programs; Random forest regression; Risk prediction,Article,Scopus

Although there are many successful examples of HATs, researchers and technology developers can see additional applications if agents were better able to understand the mental states of humans to anticipate what a team is likely to do next. Creating this capability requires the creation of models of team interaction that enable agents to interpret a team's current state and anticipate its future state. To build this model, we draw on research on collective intelligence (CI), which shows a team's capability to work together can be characterized by a latent collective intelligence factor, based on observations of work across a range of tasks, and which predicts a team's ability to accomplish a wide range of goals in the future. While some work uses a specific battery of CI tasks, more recent studies have identified observable collaborative process metrics that can be captured passively. Building on this work, we propose a method of evaluating CI by representing it as a latent variable represented by the hidden state in a Hidden Markov Model. The observations used as input to the model are the team's observable collaborative process behaviors (i.e., collective effort, use of task-related skills, and task-strategy efficiency). We show by learning the set of hidden states representing a team's observed collaborative process behaviors over time, we both learn information about the team's CI, predict how CI will evolve in the future, and suggest when an agent might intervene to improve team performance. Based on the model's observations, we discuss how it can help agents diagnose teamwork and possibly make interventions to improve CI by identifying areas of collaborative process (collective effort, skill use, or task strategy) that could be improved. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Collective intelligence; Human-autonomy teams; Machine learning,Article,Scopus

In this paper, we introduce the concept of Support Subset and a new retraining methodology for SVMs. A Support Subset is a subset of the training set, such that retraining a ML model with this subset and the new data is equivalent to training with all the data. The performance of the proposal is evaluated in a variety of experiments on simulated and real datasets in terms of time, quality of the solution, resultant support vectors, and amount of employed data.

Using WBE datasets to train machine learning algorithms and develop predictive models may also facilitate early warnings for the spread of outbreaks. The challenges associated with using machine learning for the analysis of WBE datasets and timeseries forecasting of COVID-19 were explored by running Random Forest (RF) algorithms on WBE datasets across 108 sites in five regions: Scotland, Catalonia, Ohio, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. This method uses measurements of SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragment concentration in samples taken at the inlets of wastewater treatment plants, providing insight into the prevalence of infection in upstream wastewater catchment populations. RF's forecasting performance at each site was quantitatively evaluated by determining mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values, which was used to highlight challenges affecting future implementations of RF for WBE forecasting efforts. Performance was generally poor using WBE datasets from Catalonia, Scotland, and Ohio with ‘reasonable’ or better forecasts constituting 0 %, 5 %, and 0 % of these regions' forecasts, respectively. RF's performance was much stronger with WBE data from the Netherlands and Switzerland, which provided 55 % and 45 % ‘reasonable’ or better forecasts respectively. Sampling frequency and training set size were identified as key factors contributing to accuracy, while inclusion of too many unnecessary variables (or e.g., flow data) was identified as a contributing factor to poor performance. The contribution of catchment population on forecast accuracy was more ambiguous. This study determined that the factors governing RF's forecast performance are complicated and interrelated, which presents challenges for further work in this space.

Predicting water quality parameters is very important for better management of water resources. The decision tree is one of the data mining methods that can create rules for classifying and predicting data using a tree structure. The purpose of this study is to use data mining techniques to investigate and predict the parameters of soluble phosphorus and oxygen in Lake Erie to achieve this purpose. The Classification And Regression Tree (CART) model is compared with the Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) model and the Quick Unbiased Efficient Statistical Trees (QUEST) model with the C5 model. Comparison and review of these models to express their applicability to identify water quality parameters are conducted. The results show that decision tree methods with the help of hydrochemical parameters can classify and predict water quality with high accuracy and in a short time. The number of available data is 327. To check the accuracy of the models, the difference between the observed data and the predicted data is used. In the prediction of dissolved oxygen, 214 cases with the CART model and 185 cases with the CHAID model differ by less than 2 units from the observed data. For phosphorus, 245 cases in the CART model and 237 cases in the CHAID model differ less than 0.2 the predicted data with the observed data. Therefore, the accuracy of the CART model is better. The prediction of 256 phosphorus parameter group numbers and 230 dissolved oxygen parameter group numbers with the C5 algorithm is correct. The results show that CART model is better than CHAID model in predicting data, and C5 model is better than QUEST model in predicting group numbers. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Data mining; Decision tree; Hydrochemical parameters; Machine learning; Water quality,Article,Scopus

Therefore, this paper focuses on the AE noise signal from a bridge in an operation state and other specific loading states, which is diagnosed in the hardware filtering technology, spatial identification, and self-organizing map (SOM) neural network, to obtain the new noise recognition methods. It is found that the first two methods can indeed filter the noise signal, but the filtering rate can only reach about 50%, and can barely filter strong noise signals. The SOM neural network had strong self-recognition ability. The classification accuracy of simulated AE signals is 90% and 100%, respectively.

We identify three quasiplastic deformation mechanisms in shocked n-B4C: grain boundary (GB) sliding, intergranular amorphization, and intragranular amorphization. As the deformation mechanism changes from GB sliding to intergranular amorphization at ?40 GPa, a bilinear Hugoniot behavior occurs, consistent with experimental observations.

In the present work, a reaction rate method for NO source modeling in the context of LES was proposed with the focus being placed on accurate modeling of the filtered probability density functions (FPDFs) and joint FPDFs. The NO source and various NO pathways from a direct numerical simulation (DNS) database of turbulent stratified premixed flames were conditionally averaged the progress variable and mixture fraction to provide the lookup table. A random forest (RF) model was developed for the FPDFs/joint FPDFs of the mixture fraction and progress variable. The ?-PDF model was also analyzed for comparison. First, the FPDFs and joint FPDFs predicted by the ?-PDF and RF models for the progress variable and mixture fraction were compared with those from the DNS data. It was found that the FPDFs and joint FPDFs by the RF model agree well with those from the DNS. In contrast, the ?-PDF model failed to accurately capture the joint FPDFs as the correlations of the mixture fraction and progress variable are neglected. Then, the filtered NO source and various NO pathways were modeled a-priori using the lookup table and the joint FPDFs for turbulent stratified premixed flames. The results showed that the RF model reproduces the filtered NO source and NO pathways very well, and performs much better than the ?-PDF model. Finally, a-posterior validation of the model performance was carried out in the context of LES. Various quantities from the LES were compared with the DNS filtered quantities. The results showed that the LES/RF model outperforms the LES/?-PDF model in the a-posterior simulation.

Firstly, to reduce the influence of nonlinearity, a localization method based on the combination of time and space criteria is proposed, which can overcome the drawback of the clustering method based on a spatial criterion. Subsequently, the self-training semi-supervised classification method is used to achieve semi-supervised clustering of unlabeled samples to improve the generalization performance of the soft sensor model. Afterward, based on the local semi-supervised clustering sample dataset, the soft sensor model is established according to the least squares support vector machine method. Moreover, a selective ensemble learning method based on the prediction accuracy of local models and an adaptive combination weight calculation method of sub-models is proposed to realize selective ensemble learning and improve the prediction accuracy. The parameters of the proposed method are finalized automatically by the particle swarm optimization technique.

In practical application, only little labeled data from the target subject can be obtained, so there is still a problem of how to solve the situation of no large amount of unlabeled data from the target subject. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method of similarity constraint style transfer mapping (SCSTM) and domain selection strategy with geodesic flow kernel (DSSWGFK). When calculating the mapping matrix, SCSTM maintains the local structure of the target domain by constraining the similarity of the distance among the samples of the target subject before and after mapping, which further makes use of the existing data to reduce the demand for the quantity of data from target subject. DSSWGFK obtains the weights of source domain classifiers in the ensemble classifier based on the similarity between the target subject and each source domain, which makes full use of the source domain data and reduces the demand for the quantity of data from the target subject. Experimental results show that our SCSTM method can achieve better average classification accuracy, 1.14%, 6.84% and 8.77% higher than that of supervised STM on SEED, SEED-IV and DEAP, respectively. Furthermore, DSSWGFK is capable in improving the performance of SCSTM. Finally, it can be concluded that the proposed method has achieved superior performance for emotion recognition. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Brain-computer interfaces; Emotion recognition; Style transfer mapping; Transfer learning,Article,Scopus

The model form error is quantified using Bayesian state estimation with observation data, and a probabilistic machine learning model is trained to predict the output discrepancy for untrained inputs.

For many approaches, features are directly extracted from whole spectral pixels, which can not well describe local characteristics. These methods are also susceptible to noise since each feature code is learned individually. Accordingly, a binary feature learning method with local spectral context-aware attention (BFLSC) is proposed for the classification. Specifically, for training samples, we first build the local spectrum models (LSMs) to describe local spectral properties, where each training sample is segmented into some parts and the difference between the central value and its neighborhoods is calculated in each part. Then, we construct the BFLSC model to learn a projection and binary features of training samples. In such model, the spectral context-awareness attention is established to collaboratively learn binary feature codes by enforcing one shift between 0/1 of each LSM, which enhances the robustness and stability of binary leaning. We also introduce the loss constraint, even distribution constraint, and variance constraint to reduce information loss and improve the quality of learned feature distribution. Additionally, an optimization scheme is designed to obtain the solution of the BFLSC model. Further, the learned binary features are added to train the support vector machine (SVM). For each testing sample, the LSMs are first extracted, and then mapped into binary features by the learned projection. The trained SVM is finally used for the mapped binary features to predict the label of the testing sample. Experimental results validate that our BFLSC realizes the better performance compared with some advanced approaches. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Binary feature learning; Classification of hyperspectral images; Local spectrum modules; Spectral context-awareness,Article,Scopus

It can be fabricated with the three dimensional (3D) lithography technology, which is able to encode high density data information within multi-dimensions. To obtain robust information readout, spectra with a broad wavelength range and with a large angle range are combined for a high sensitivity.

For a 4-unit nanostructure, the 27 data sequences with 20% spectral noise, a 100% readout accuracy can be achieved. High readout speed is also demanded in optical storage. Therefore, we reduced the number of the selected wavelengths and angles in the spectra.

Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), though considered the standard testing measure, has low sensitivity and is time-consuming, which restricts the fast screening of individuals. Therefore, computer tomography (CT) is used to complement the traditional approaches and provide fast and effective screening over other diagnostic methods. This work aims to appraise the importance of chest CT findings of COVID-19 and post-COVID in the diagnosis and prognosis of infected patients and to explore the ways and means to integrate CT findings for the development of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool-based predictive diagnostic techniques. Methods: The retrospective study includes a 188 patient database with COVID-19 infection confirmed by RT-PCR testing, including post-COVID patients. Patients underwent chest high-resolution computer tomography (HRCT), where the images were evaluated for common COVID-19 findings and involvement of the lung and its lobes based on the coverage region. The radiological modalities analyzed in this study may help the researchers in generating a predictive model based on AI tools for further classification with a high degree of reliability. Results: Mild to moderate ground glass opacities (GGO) with or without consolidation, crazy paving patterns, and halo signs were common COVID-19 related findings. A CT score is assigned to every patient based on the severity of lung lobe involvement. Conclusion: Typical multifocal, bilateral, and peripheral distributions of GGO are the main characteristics related to COVID-19 pneumonia. Chest HRCT can be considered a standard method for timely and efficient assessment of disease progression and management severity.

However, the scale of the problem is not yet fully known as the smallest micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) cannot accurately be measured due to limitations in measurement and detection techniques. In this paper, we combine the nanoscale resolution of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with the spectroscopic power of cathodoluminescence (CL) to show that six of the most common plastics – HDPE, LDPE, PP, PA, PS and PET – have unique spectra that could help in identifying the smallest MNPs. This was done by building a spectral database using 111 plastic samples from reference and consumer plastics with different sizes (0.001–1 mm), colours (e.g. black, blue, green, red, white/transparent and yellow) and shapes (e.g. irregular, fibre, spheres). We then trained multiple classification models using an Artificial Neural Network approach. With the use of these classification models we were able to classify the six plastics, including difficult samples such as black coloured plastics, based on their CL spectra with 97% accuracy, showing that our approach is robust towards sample differences. As most misclassifications occurred between LDPE and HDPE, a separate model for LDPE and HDPE allowed for >99% accuracy for the classification of HDPE and LDPE by using a two-step approach. This novel “proof-of-concept” to MNP analysis demonstrates the utility of SEM paired with CL to characterise microplastics with detailed spatial and chemical resolution warranting its further development and adoption. © 2022",Cathodoluminescence; Machine learning; Plastic analysis; Scanning electron microscopy,Article,Scopus

SDCM is implemented for flow simulation in industrial scale pipelines. The basic concept of SDCM is adaptively adjusting the spatial mesh resolution according to the spatial distribution of contamination. The communication between spatial meshes with different resolutions is achieved by machine learning technology in SDCM. The validation of training and predicting process in SDCM indicates the artificial neural networks (ANN)-based method could efficiently construct the implicit function between the contamination concentration and spatial coordinates in pipelines. Then, the detailed implementation of ISSM, which is a hybrid of CDTM and SDCM, is given. The accuracy and efficiency are validated by both the direct numerical simulation results and practical experiments in industry multiproduct pipelines.

After capturing street-view images, traffic-flow data, and environmental-sensor data covering the streets to be analyzed, we automatically calculate physical walkability from four criteria (walkability index, street quality, traffic flow, and physical environment). We first integrate 2-dimensional analysis of walk score, noise, and light using GIS, then perform 3-dimensional composition calculations of greenery, enclosure, and relative walking width using semantic segmentation, vehicle density using multi-object tracking, and indicator weighting distributions using an analytic hierarchy process. Perceived walkability is evaluated by a hierarchy of walking needs model comprising feasibility, accessibility, safety, comfort, and pleasurability. As an empirical study, we conduct an experiment within Anonymous University for physical and perceived walkability evaluations.

This study examines the usefulness of the nonlinearly generated second harmonic portion of the backscatter signal and the effects of a variety of attenuation compensation techniques for noninvasively characterizing human carotid plaque using spectral analysis and machine learning. Post-beamformed ultrasound backscatter radiofrequency (RF) data were acquired from 6 normal subjects and 119 carotid endarterectomy patients prior to surgery. Plaque obtained following surgery was histologically processed, and regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to homogenous tissue types (fibrous/fibro-lipidic, hemorrhagic and/or necrotic core and calcified) were selected from RF data. Both the harmonic and fundamental power spectra for each ROI was obtained and normalized by data from a uniform phantom (0.5 dB/cm-MHz slope of attenuation). Additional attenuation compensation approaches were compared to simply using the reference phantom: (1) optimum power spectral shift estimation, (2) one-step adventitial, or (3) two-step adventitial. Spectral parameters extracted from both the fundamental and harmonic estimates of the backscatter transfer function of 363 ROI's from 152 plaque specimens were used to train and test random forest and support vector machine classification models. The best results came from using spectral parameters derived from both the fundamental and second harmonic bands with a predictive accuracy of 65–68%, kappa statistic of 0.49–0.54, and accuracies of 84% for fibrous, 68–74% for hemorrhagic and/or necrotic core, and 78–81% for calcified ROI's.

Besides, they lack the multi-level (both pixel-level and sample-level) feature learning ability to reveal the complex semantic characteristics in histology tissue images. For these challenging problems, we proposed a Label Diffusion Graph Learning (LDGL) method, which can optimize the model in a semi-supervised manner with limited labels, and then adopt graph convolution layers to mine correlations among different breast tissues. Concretely, our LDGL model first employs a convolutional neural network and graph convolution network to extract comprehensive multi-level representations. Then it improves the identification capability through a multi-level consistency loss among unlabeled breast images. Finally, a novel pseudo-label building method is introduced to combine confidence, graph degree, and the expected calibration error to expand labeled data via credible breast samples. To prove the excellent recognition performance of our LDGL model, we compare it with several superior breast cancer histological image recognition approaches. The results indicate that our model (with only 20% labels) achieves 95.05% Accuracy, 95.27% Precision, 95.05% Recall, and 95.0% F1-score, separately. Moreover, we also verify the contribution of each module in LDGL through a series of ablation experiments. In conclusion, the evaluation proves that our LDGL model is excellent and robust for semi-supervised breast histological image recognition task. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Breast histological image recognition; Graph Learning; Label Diffusion; Semi-supervised learning,Article,Scopus

Consequently, researchers and transport engineers continue their efforts to improve road safety and minimize road crashes. With the increasing availability of various sensor technologies to capture road safety-related data and the recent breakthrough in modern data-driven techniques, in particular Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques, data-driven road safety research has gained significant attention in the past few years. As road safety involves a number of different aspects, including road infrastructure (e.g., surface conditions), road user behaviors (e.g., driver/pedestrian behavior), and traffic congestion, critically reviewing all these major aspects and their relationships with road crashes is a challenging task. In this paper, we present a detailed review of 70 articles, which are shortlisted from 2871 articles found by searching relevant keywords from the scopus IEEE digital library and google scholar databases. To better analyze the data-driven road safety research a number of taxonomies are first introduced to characterize data sources Equipment & sensors to capture data And methodologies to analyze and make decisions based on data.

Concentration changes in HbO and HbR help in classifying the cognitive states of human brain. There are several machine learning classification techniques to distinguish different cognitive states. Some conventional machine learning methods, which are easier to implement, undergo a complex processing phase before training the network and also suffer from low accuracy due to inappropriate data preprocessing. Deep learning based convolutional neural network (CNN) having automatic feature engineering capability plays a very important role in efficiently classifying different cognitive states. The present work uses two open-access datasets on fNIRS signal. The datasets are taken for two cognitive states: mental task (MT) and resting state or baseline task (BL). The concentration changes of HbO and HbR are computed using the modified Beer–Lambert law. The band-pass filter is used to remove additional noise from the signals. Here, topographical brain images are generated from the data of 2 s window with 1 s overlapping for both HbO and HbR. Global normalization is applied to the filtered data for better visualization of the images. The brain images are fed to the proposed CNN model in order to classify them into MT or BL. The accuracy of the classification and the comparative study shows the superiority of the proposed model over two existing models. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Baseline task (BL); Cognitive load; Deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbR); Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS); Mental arithmetic (MA); Oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO),Article,Scopus

However, reliability depends on factors affecting the communication channel. In this paper the effects of recording device mismatch are analyzed. Multicondition training (MCT) is proposed to improve robustness against that mismatch. Methods: An experiment on 30 PD patients and 30 healthy subjects was designed. 3 vocalizations of sustained ?a? were recorded using a smartphone. These recordings, along with a simulation of 8 additional smartphones, were analyzed. Acoustical features were extracted and averaged per patient and recording device. Machine learning was used to distinguish healthy from PD patients by using different combinations of train-test smartphones. Results: By using the same device for training and testing, a 10% best–worse mean accuracy drop is observed. The gap among different devices reaches 37%. MCT retains 90% of the maximum accuracy and exceeds a 20% mean accuracy while lowers dispersion of the aggregated results obtained with single condition. Smartphone position shows a direct impact on performance. Conclusion: Recording device has a major effect on results. It is also found that positioning of the recording device might also be influential. Using MCT appears to improve robustness. Significance: Results support the use of mobile devices to create an automated PD detection test.

Rather than utilizing the spatial information of the original delayed-enhancement magnetic resonance (DE-MRI) images, Auto-MyIn uses the textural information obtained by applying grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) of four different grey levels to train the three CNNs (ResNet-18, DarkNet-19, and SqueezeNet). First, the images generated from each GLCM grey level are used to train each CNN individually. Next, for each GLCM grey level, the textural-based deep features extracted from the three CNNs are concatenated and used to train several support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Finally, Auto-MyIn fuses textural-based deep features of the four GLCM grey levels using principal component analysis (PCA). The results of Auto-MyIn indicated that fusing the textural-based deep features of each level of GLCM is better than the end-to-end deep learning classification of the three CNNs trained with each grey level of GLCM images. Furthermore, it showed that fusing textural-based deep features of the four grey levels of the GLCM using PCA has further improvement on diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, the results prove that using textural information is superior to using spatial information of the original DE-MRI images. In addition, the results of Auto-MyIn when compared with other related studies demonstrated its competitive ability. Moreover, the performance of Auto-MyIn shows an accuracy of 0.984, a sensitivity of 0.992, specificity of 0.968, and precision of 0.967, which indicate that it is a reliable tool, therefore it could be employed to help in the clinical decision making and facilitate the diagnostic process of MI thus avoiding the limitations of manual diagnosis. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Artificial Intelligence (AI); Cardiovascular (CV) Diseases; Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); Deep Learning; Grey level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM); Myocardial Infarction (MI) Diagnosis; Support Vector Machine (SVM),Article,Scopus

Traditional 2D brain tumor segmentation methods seriously ignore the spatial context features of brain tumor MRI images, so how to achieve accurate segmentation of brain tumor regions with multiple modalities is the main problem. The paper proposes a 3D convolutional neural network with 3D multi-branch attention - MBANet. First, the optimized shuffle unit is used to form the basic unit (BU) module of MBANet. In the BU module, the group convolution is used to perform convolution operation after the input channel is split, and the channel shuffle is used to scramble the convolutional channels after fusion. Then, MBANet uses a novel multi-branch 3D Shuffle Attention (SA) module as the attention layer in the encoder. The 3D SA module groups along the channel dimension and divides the feature maps into small features. For each small feature, the 3D SA module builds both channel attention and spatial attention while adopting the BU module. In addition, in order to recover the resolution of the upsampling semantic features better, a 3D SA module is also used in the skip connection of MBANet. Experiments on the BraTS 2018 and BraTS 2019 show that the dice of ET, WT and TC reach 80.18%, 89.80%, 85.47% and 78.21%, 89.79%, 83.04%, respectively.

However, most previous discriminative studies of SZ patients using machine learning methods were based on MRI features of brain regions, ignoring brain connectivity and its network topology. We addressed these limitations by applying a graph convolutional network (GCN) to classify schizophrenia patients with brain region and connectivity features derived from a combined functional MRI and connectomics analysis. In this study, 140 schizophrenia patients and 205 normal controls were included, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data were acquired for each subject. Brain region features, including the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and degree centrality (DC), were computed by MRI analysis and connectomics analysis, respectively. Moreover, brain connectivity features were explored by connectomics analysis. A GCN method was proposed to learn network representations to discriminate patients with schizophrenia from normal controls. Compared with the traditional machine learning and deep learning methods based on MRI features of brain regions, the proposed method based on a combined functional MRI and connectomics analysis can effectively improve classification performance. Specifically, we obtained an average accuracy of 92.47%, and the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, precision and F1-score reached 95.36%, 88.70%, 95.06%, 92.87%, and 90.45%, respectively.

State-of-the-art machine learning methods are effectively detecting abrupt changes in system states. However, these methods lack comparable maturity in detecting subtle changes that may be signs of incipient faults. This manuscript argues that the current anomaly detection methods can be enhanced by exploring weak patterns to enable subtle variation detection. Specifically, the concept of semi-supervised learning is employed, with labels representing knowledge about some anomalous conditions of a system. The basic idea is to extract a candidate set of weak patterns discarded by state-of-the-art baselining algorithms. With few labeled anomalous data, the algorithm selects the weak patterns and allows for their possible fusion using the highest sensitivity to the labeled anomalies. The method's applicability is demonstrated using a representative pressurized water reactor (PWR) model simulated by Dymola. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Feature extraction; Feature fusion; High-order features; Subtle anomaly detection,Article,Scopus

Exhaust emitted from burning fossil fuels affects both environment and human health. The present study uses non-edible rubber seed oil (RSO) biodiesel with hydrogen in an unmodified diesel engine. The experiments were carried out with 10 %, 20 %, and 30 % biodiesel blends with 10 L/min of constant hydrogen supply. A series of experiments were conducted in the constant engine speed with a varying load of 0–100 % in intervals of 25 %. The hydrogen has been supplied to the combustion chamber via an air intake manifold. Using RSO biodiesel blends with hydrogen increases brake thermal efficiency at lower fraction ratio. Further, the fuel consumption was low when 10 % of biodiesel was used with hydrogen. As the concentration of the blends increased, both brake thermal efficiency and brake specific fuel consumption were massively affected due to the higher viscosity and lower heating values. Due to the effect of heating value, the exhaust gas temperature for the biodiesel blends was higher. The emission of the pollutants such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and oxides of nitrogen was reduced due to the addition of biodiesel and hydrogen blends to the diesel. Considering the findings, the blend with 10 % biodiesel with 10 L/min hydrogen can be a potential alternative for diesel. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Biodiesel; Combustion; Hydrogen; Long short-term memory; Machine leaning; Rubber seed oil,Article,Scopus

In the fourth study, the results of the SSimDCL and the VolBrain brain magnetic resonance imaging segmentation results, which are widely used today, are included. When VolBrain segmentation and SSimDCL segmentation are compared. The results were compared both visually and metrically. Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), Kernel Inception Distance (KID), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) were used as measurement metrics. The Jaccard and Dice similarity metrics were also used in the analysis. It was observed that the SSimDCL give satisfactory results in all four studies.

Thus, the development of computer-aided detection (CAD) systems that are capable of accurately distinguishing COVID-19 from other diseases using chest computed tomography (CT) and X-ray data is of immediate priority. Such automatic systems are usually based on traditional machine learning or deep learning methods. Differently from most of the existing studies, which used either CT scan or X-ray images in COVID-19-case classification, we present a new, simple but efficient deep learning feature fusion model, called UncertaintyFuseNet, which is able to classify accurately large datasets of both of these types of images. We argue that the uncertainty of the model's predictions should be taken into account in the learning process, even though most of the existing studies have overlooked it. We quantify the prediction uncertainty in our feature fusion model using effective Ensemble Monte Carlo Dropout (EMCD) technique. A comprehensive simulation study has been conducted to compare the results of our new model to the existing approaches, evaluating the performance of competing models in terms of Precision, Recall, F-Measure, Accuracy and ROC curves. The obtained results prove the efficiency of our model which provided the prediction accuracy of 99.08% and 96.35% for the considered CT scan and X-ray datasets, respectively.

To effectively overcome the irreversible damage caused by minimally invasive arthroscopy, this paper proposes a dual-stream parallel diagnostic model (LC-DSPNet) based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which has high spatial resolution and strong contrast structure to achieve automatic noninvasive cartilage injury preview. To lessen reliance on massive datasets, the proposed algorithm incorporates fine cartilage texture and regional information into global multi-scale lesion features via the local centroid optimization (LCO) algorithm. It can not only generate more comprehensive cartilage injury images, but also obtain an exquisite universality and real-time damage classification network by fewer hospital genuine medical images. By evaluating the proposed framework with the influence of single-input or multi-input samples on the final classification, the experiment indicates that the LC-DSPNet method has good performance.

This structure separates the atoms into distances not encountered in their pure state nor disordered solid solutions and this provides the opportunity for exploring a range of novel material properties.

However, their optimization is computationally demanding, and requires careful hyperparameter tuning, potentially leading to suboptimal robustness evaluations. To overcome these issues, we propose ImageNet-Patch, a dataset to benchmark machine-learning models against adversarial patches. The dataset is built by first optimizing a set of adversarial patches against an ensemble of models, using a state-of-the-art attack that creates transferable patches. The corresponding patches are then randomly rotated and translated, and finally applied to the ImageNet data. We use ImageNet-Patch to benchmark the robustness of 127 models against patch attacks, and also validate the effectiveness of the given patches in the physical domain (i.e., by printing and applying them to real-world objects). We conclude by discussing how our dataset could be used as a benchmark for robustness, and how our methodology can be generalized to other domains.

In this paper, we introduce WikiDes, a novel dataset to generate short descriptions of Wikipedia articles for the problem of text summarization. The dataset consists of over 80k English samples on 6987 topics. We set up a two-phase summarization method — description generation (Phase I) and candidate ranking (Phase II) — as a strong approach that relies on transfer and contrastive learning. For description generation, T5 and BART show their superiority compared to other small-scale pre-trained models. By applying contrastive learning with the diverse input from beam search, the metric fusion-based ranking models outperform the direct description generation models significantly up to ? 22 ROUGE in topic-exclusive split and topic-independent split. Furthermore, the outcome descriptions in Phase II are supported by human evaluation in over 45.33% chosen compared to 23.66% in Phase I against the gold descriptions. In the aspect of sentiment analysis, the generated descriptions cannot effectively capture all sentiment polarities from paragraphs while doing this task better from the gold descriptions. The automatic generation of new descriptions reduces the human efforts in creating them and enriches Wikidata-based knowledge graphs. Our paper shows a practical impact on Wikipedia and Wikidata since there are thousands of missing descriptions. Finally, we expect WikiDes to be a useful dataset for related works in capturing salient information from short paragraphs.

Many scientists believe that the pandemic originated from Wuhan, China, before spreading to other parts of the globe. To reduce the spread of the disease, decision makers encouraged measures such as hand washing, face masking, and social distancing. In early 2021, some countries including the United States began administering COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccination brought a relief to the public; it also generated a lot of debates from anti-vaccine and pro-vaccine groups. The controversy and debate surrounding COVID-19 vaccine influenced the decision of several people in either to accept or reject vaccination. Because of data limitations, social media data, collected through live streaming public tweets using an Application Programming Interface (API) search, is considered a viable and reliable resource to study the opinion of the public on Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy. Thus, this study examines 3 sentiment computation methods (Azure Machine Learning, VADER, and TextBlob) to analyze COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Five learning algorithms (Random Forest, Logistics Regression, Decision Tree, LinearSVC, and Naïve Bayes) with different combination of three vectorization methods (Doc2Vec, CountVectorizer, and TF-IDF) were deployed. Vocabulary normalization was threefold; potter stemming, lemmatization, and potter stemming with lemmatization. For each vocabulary normalization strategy, we designed, developed, and evaluated 42 models. The study shows that Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy slowly decreases over time; suggesting that the public gradually feels warm and optimistic about COVID-19 vaccination. Moreover, combining potter stemming and lemmatization increased model performances. Finally, the result of our experiment shows that TextBlob + TF-IDF + LinearSVC has the best performance in classifying public sentiment into positive, neutral, or negative with an accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score of 0.96752, 0.96921, 0.92807 and 0.94702 respectively. It means that the best performance was achieved when using TextBlob sentiment score, with TF-IDF vectorization and LinearSVC classification model. We also found out that combining two vectorizations (CountVectorizer and TF-IDF) decreases model accuracy. © 2022 The Authors",Covid-19; Machine Learning; Sentiment Analysis; Twitter; Vaccine Hesitancy,Article,Scopus

However, detection of H. contortus infections by routine observation of sheep flocks is difficult, and producers are usually unaware of a problem until animals are severely infected. The aim of the current study was to explore the potential for accelerometer-based activity monitoring to detect H. contortus infections in sheep. A three-month clinical study was conducted in Central Queensland, Australia, whereby 45, 12-month-old merino wethers were randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups: control (n = 9), low H. contortus infection (n = 18) or high H. contortus infection (n = 18). Infection occurred on Day 0, and accelerometer sensors were attached to a halter and deployed on all animals from Day 21 to Day 70. Animals were sampled weekly (faecal and blood) and treated with an anthelmintic on Day 56. Following the clinical period, five study animals were observed for a total of five hours to compare direct behavioral observations against accelerometer data. This was then used to develop a machine learning (ML) model to classify the accelerometer data into active or inactive behavior, which was further summarized to determine the proportion of time spent active per day. The most valuable features in the selected ML model were movement variation (MV), maximum X-axis value (MaxX), standard deviation of the X-axis (SDX), maximum Y-axis value (MaxY) and standard deviation of the Z-axis (SDZ). Linear mixed-effects models identified a significant difference in all sheep activity pre- and post-anthelmintic drench on Day 56 (P &lt; 0.001). Conversely, there was no significant difference between activity levels of infected animals compared to controls (P = 0.14). To further explore how the activity of sheep changed with clinical presentations of H. contortus infections, weekly faecal egg count (FEC) and blood packed cell volume (PCV) were compared to sheep activity using a Spearman's rank correlation test. There was a weak but significant negative correlation between FEC and sheep activity (P &lt; 0.001) and a weak but significant positive correlation between PCV and sheep activity (P &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, this study has shown that accelerometer-based activity monitoring may be able to identify changes in sheep activity associated with clinical presentations of H. contortus infections and between periods prior to and following anthelmintic treatment. However, the ability to detect activity differences between infected and control animals was less clear. Further research is needed to determine the impact of individual behavior variability and flock dynamics when using on-animal sensors for the detection of behavioral changes associated with disease. © 2022",Accelerometer; Nematode; Parasite; Precision Livestock Management; Remote detection; Sheep,Article,Scopus

Chronic diseases are one of the most serious health challenges in developing and developed countries. According to WHO, this accounts for 73% of all deaths and 60% of the global burden of diseases. Chronic disease classification models are now harnessing the potential of lifelog data to explore better healthcare practices. This paper basically constructs an optimal feature selection-based hybrid model which is designed by integrating k-means clustering for handling unlabeled data, applying Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), selecting optimal features using PCA, and applying Random Forest (RF) classifier to classify chronic diseases. Since lifelog data analysis is crucial due to its sensitive nature; thus the conventional classification models show limited performance. Therefore, designing new classifiers for the classification of chronic diseases using lifelog data is the need of the age. The vital part of building a good model depends on pre-processing of the dataset, identifying important features, and then training a learning algorithm with suitable hyper parameters for better performance. The proposed approach improves the performance of existing methods using a series of steps such as (i) removing redundant or invalid instances, (ii) making the data labeled using clustering and partitioning the data into classes, (iii) making the classes balance to avoid biased result across majority class (iv) identifying the suitable subset of features by applying either some domain knowledge or selection algorithm, (v) hyper parameter tuning for models to get best results (vi) developing a new hybrid model i.e. optimal feature selection based unsupervised random forest classifier (OFS-URFC), which gives best results in binary classification as well as multiclass classification and (vii) performance of this newly designed classifier is also evaluated using Spark streaming environment for processing the data in real time fashion. For this purpose, two-time series datasets are used in the experiment to compute the accuracy, recall, precision, and f1-score etc. The experimental analysis proves the suitability of the proposed approach as compared to the conventional classifiers and our newly constructed model achieved highest accuracy and reduced training complexity among all. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Chronic diseases; Classification; Clustering; Hyper parameter; Lifelog data; Machine learning; Optimal feature selection,Article,Scopus

Considering the potential and wide applicability of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in input-output mapping, these were examined in this research for modelling ET0 utilising a variety of meteorological data, including maximum temperature (Tmax) and minimum temperature (Tmin), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (WS), and bright sunshine hours (BSS). The different AI models investigated in this study include Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), M5 Tree and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). The implemented daily dataset was collected from the Sardarkrushinagar station which is located at the North Gujarat region of India. For performance verification of the developed AI models, the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation was employed as a benchmark. The developed model's accuracy was assessed using multiple quantitative metrics, including R2, NSE, RMSE, Pdv and MAE. The performance of ANN models was found better compared to the ELM, M5 Tree, and MLR models in terms of different performance indicators. The model's outcomes were highly practical and reliable for the investigated case studies. Another important finding in this research was that the selection of the appropriate input variables in models allows not only error minimization but also enhances the co-relationship amongst the dependant as well as independent variables. © 2022 The Author(s)",Artificial neural network; Extreme learning machine; Limited weather data; M5 tree; Reference evapotranspiration; Semi arid region,Article,Scopus

In this project, a three-component cloudless internet-of-things (IoT)-based irrigation network is designed and constructed to affordably integrate into existing irrigation infrastructure and approach zero water wastage while maintaining crops at a perceived healthy threshold. A Raspberry Pi-based electrical circuit of sensors and drone are constructed to collect environmental data and extract brightness-adjusted HSV crop color using k-means clustering-based computer vision algorithms. A semi-supervised approach is used to train a bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network, which enables long-term and working memory analysis within hidden layers for time-sensitive outputs. The resulting predicted irrigation volume is executed by an Arduino Nano-based irrigation micropiece to dynamically adjust the water flow to each crop for individualized irrigation. Induction from water flow through irrigation pipes generates current, yielding complete and scalable power self-sufficiency at an excess margin of 25.8%. Empirical data collection reflects a 68.8% increase in irrigation effectiveness for crop growth. Model testing on various African nation crop yields and corresponding satellite images (n = 10,301) reflects an accuracy rate of 89.1% and a binary classification success of 96.0% after a single growth cycle.

This study proposes a procedure for regulating the bulkhead pressure by combining numerical simulations and data mining, and applies the procedure to a metro line constructed in sandy pebble stratum using EPB shield. Firstly, the relationship between the bulkhead pressure and the pressure on the tunnel face is carefully obtained from discrete element modeling, and the required supporting earth pressure is derived by considering the arching effect. Secondly, aided with the machine learning method, a model is constructed for predicting the average bulkhead pressure per ring according to the operational parameters (i.e., the average driving speed and the rotation speed of the screw conveyor). Given the target value of the bulkhead pressure, the optimal values of the operational parameters are obtained from the model. In addition, an autoregressive moving average stochastic process model is developed to monitor the real-time fluctuation of the bulkhead pressure and guide the actions taken in time to avoid dramatic fluctuations. The results indicate that the pressure difference between the tunnel face and the bulkhead is considerable, and the consideration of the arching effect can avoid overestimating the bulkhead pressure. A combination of the machine learning model and the stochastic process model provides a plausible performance in regulating the bulkhead pressure around the target value without dramatic fluctuation. © 2022",Autoregressive moving average model; Bulkhead pressure; Discrete element method; EPB shield machine; Support vector regression,Article,Scopus

There are numerous incentives to generate electricity using roof-top Photovoltaic (PV) panels as it reduces the costs, grid dependency and partially replaces gas or other heating source. However, solutions to optimally use the local solar energy for off-grid and on-grid prosumers are incomplete and do not provide an efficient ready-to-use implementation schema. Thus, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive Optimization and Control (AOC) module for residential appliances using Internet of Things (IoT). It consists of forecasting the PV output, optimizing the schedule and controlling the prosumers’ appliances in real-time to maximize the PV usage. This solution provides the layout concept and practical implementation in a real environment. For seasonal simulation, various prosumer profiles (on– and off-grid), with or without storage and different generation capacities are considered. The optimization process brings clear benefits for all types of prosumers, but the real-time monitoring and control algorithm is more valuable as it considers the current PV output and adapts the load in real-time so that to further enhance the Self-Sustainable Ratio (SSR). Furthermore, it protects the battery and prolongs its lifetime by reducing the number of charge/discharge cycles. On average, the SSR increases significantly by 12 or 13%. The SSR goes up to 93%, meaning that the consumption from grid is considerably reduced. More significantly, the impact on the environment and life quality will be consistent as the residential sector represents 27% of the total energy consumption, out of which 62.8% for heating. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Forecast; Heuristic optimization; IoT; Machine learning; Prosumers; PV,Article,Scopus

The diagnosis of PD is a difficult and time-consuming task, and there is no definitive protocol for achieving it. Therefore, several studies have been performed in order to find reliable PD biomarkers. The analysis of characteristics of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is one of the techniques that have been used in the search for biomarkers. EEG signals capture the activity of neurons through electrodes placed on the scalp and with the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, their characteristics have started to be used in machine learning (ML) algorithms for the automatic diagnosis of brain diseases, suggesting that EEG signals are promising biomarkers that could be used for automatic identification of individuals with PD. Thus, this work evaluates the performance of Hjorth features obtained from electroencephalographic signals, as biomarkers for Parkinson's disease. Using the database available at the public repository called The Patient Repository for EEG Data + Computational Tools (PRED + CT), we analyzed EEG data from PD individuals periodically exposed to auditory stimuli. The analysis of the proposed biomarkers showed differences between healthy and PD patients in parietal, frontal, central, and occipital lobes. For classification the Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest algorithms were used followed by a 5-fold cross-validation methodology. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 89.56% when differentiating patients with PD and healthy individuals with an SVM classifier. The results suggest that the Hjorth features extracted from EEG signals could be used as PD biomarkers. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",EEG; Hjorth features; Machine learning; Parkinson's disease,Article,Scopus

They are bursts of electrical discharge that can cause a wide range of symptoms such as distraction or involuntary spasms involving the whole body. Preictal phase carries some important features related to seizures which can be found before seizure onset. Hence, this study introduces an efficient hybrid training procedure for machine learning (ML) classifiers that are able to classify Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for the accurate detection of preictal phase. Essentially, the proposed approach consists of two stages: feature extraction and model estimation with feature selection. In this approach, while the feature extraction is executed by using wavelet transform, the model estimation is performed by hybrid ML classifiers. Essentially, this approach integrates the training mechanism with a novel feature subset and model selection procedure based on the Information Complexity Criteria (ICOMP) and Genetic Algorithms. For preictal phase detection application, the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG dataset was analyzed by both the proposed and traditional approaches. From the analysis results, it can be concluded that the hybrid ML classifiers not only produce robust models in the context of model information complexity, but also provide superior performance outputs than the classical approaches with respect to validity and reliability, over test datasets. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Epilepsy; Feature extraction; Feature selection; Genetic algorithms; ICOMP; Machine learning classifiers; Preictal; Wavelet transform,Article,Scopus

With many well-performing state-of-the-art classifiers available, there is a growing need for understanding interpretability of a classifier necessitated by practical purposes such as to find the best diet recommendation for a diabetes patient. Inverse classification is a post modeling process to find changes in input features of samples to alter the initially predicted class. It is useful in many business applications to determine how to adjust a sample input data such that the classifier predicts it to be in a desired class. In real world applications, a budget on perturbations of samples corresponding to customers or patients is usually considered, and in this setting, the number of successfully perturbed samples is key to increase benefits. In this study, we propose a new framework to solve inverse classification that maximizes the number of perturbed samples subject to a per-feature-budget limits and favorable classification classes of the perturbed samples. We design algorithms to solve this optimization problem based on gradient methods, stochastic processes, Lagrangian relaxations, and the Gumbel trick. In experiments, we find that our algorithms based on stochastic processes exhibit an excellent performance in different budget settings and they scale well. The relative improvement of the proposed stochastic algorithms over an existing method with a traditional formulation is 15% in the real-world dataset and 21% in two public datasets on average. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Adversarial learning; Counterfactual explanation; Inverse classification; Machine learning; Neural networks,Article,Scopus

The mechanisms of flame spread over solid fuel are commonly described by means of dimensionless numbers or scaling analysis that describes the balanced relationship of several processes. However, these approaches rely on prior knowledge or explicit assumption of the relevant physical processes, and it is difficult to spatially distinguish among multiple physical processes. This work demonstrated a generalized way using an unsupervised machine learning method based on the Gaussian mixture models and sparse principal component analysis (GMM-SPCA) to automatically delineates the spatial domain of the FSS from a numerical simulation into several regions that are dominated by the balance between different physical processes. The idea of equation space is employed such that each coordinate in the equation space corresponds to a specific physical process as represented by the individual term in the corresponding governing equation. The dominant heat/mass transport processes for both gas and solid phases have been analyzed, and their spatial correspondence for the fields of temperature, flow, and species has been discussed. Some critical characteristics, such as the flame stand-off distance profile, the triple flame structure, and the pyrolysis zone of the solid fuel have been properly identified and quantified. It is demonstrated that the generalized GMM-SPCA method provides an intuitive insight into the heat and mass transfer processes of the FSS for further development of the flame spread model. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS",Dominant physical processes; Flame spread; GMM-SPCA method; Machine learning,Article,Scopus

Experimental results on four public datasets verified the superiority of the proposed hybrid model over standard CNN and deep transfer learning models in adapting the classifier to new sensor locations and subjects quickly, where the HAR accuracy can be improved by at least 12% for cross-person transfer and 20% for cross-position transfer, respectively. © 2022",Convolution neural network (CNN); Cross-position; Deep adaptation transfer learning; Human activity recognition (HAR); Online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM),Article,Scopus

Analysing these datasets often requires the application of feature selection techniques in order to reduce the dimensionality of the data and prioritize features for downstream knowledge generation tasks. Effective feature selection is a key part of clustering, regression and classification. It presents a myriad of opportunities to improve the machine learning pipeline: eliminating redundant and irrelevant features, reducing model over-fitting, faster model training times and more explainable models. By contrast, and despite the widespread availability and use of categorical data in practice, feature selection for categorical and/or mixed data has received relatively little attention in comparison to numerical data. Furthermore, existing feature selection methods for mixed data are sensitive to number of objects by having nonlinear time complexities with respect to number of objects. In this work, we propose a generic multiple association measure for mixed datasets and a novel feature selection algorithm that uses multiple association across features. Our algorithm is based upon the belief that the most representative chosen set of features should be as diverse and minimally dependent on each other as possible. The proposed algorithm formulates the problem of feature selection as an optimization problem, searching for the set of features that have minimum association amongst them. We present a generic multiple association measure and two associated feature selection algorithms: Naive and Greedy Feature Selection Algorithms called NFSA and GFSA, respectively. Our proposed GFSA algorithm is evaluated on 15 benchmark datasets, and compared to four existing state of the art feature selection techniques. We demonstrate that our approach provides comparable downstream classification performance outperforming other leading techniques on several datasets. Both time complexity analysis and experimental results show that our proposed algorithm significantly reduces the processing time required for unsupervised feature selection algorithms especially for long datasets which have a huge number of objects, whilst also yielding comparable clustering and classification performance. On the other hand, we do not recommend our approach for wide datasets where the number of features is huge with respect to the number of objects e.g., image, text and genome datasets. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Categorical data; Feature engineering; Feature selection; Measures of association; Mixed data; Multiple association,Article,Scopus

The standard multi-class classification online learning setting assumes continuous availability of the ground-truth class labels. However, in many real-life applications, only partial feedback of the predicted label can be obtained and only the correctness of the prediction is available. Hence, knowledge of the correct label is missing in the case of erroneous predictions. In this case, learning may be slower and classifiers less accurate than in the full feedback scenario. Although several online learning algorithms with partial feedback have been proposed, real-world applications would still benefit from further performance improvement. In this paper, we exploit transfer learning to improve learning in the case of erroneous predictions. We propose the Partial Feedback Online Transfer Learning (PFOTL) algorithm, which uses learned knowledge from the source domain in addition to received partial feedback, and present analysis and a mistake bound for the algorithm. In our experimental results on four benchmark datasets, the proposed algorithm achieves higher online cumulative accuracy than the comparable state-of-the-art algorithms.

S3C aims to reduce the performance degradation probability of wrong prior knowledge. The existing S3C methods tries to artificially estimate the risk or safety degrees through a predefined formula. The performance of S3C heavily depends on the quality of the formula. To alleviate the influence of the artificially defined formula, it is meaningful to develop an novel S3C version which can adaptively estimate the safety degrees. To achieve the goal, we propose an adaptive safety-aware semi-supervised fuzzy c-means algorithm (AS3FCM) which is used to deal with mislabeled instances. In order to adaptively estimate the safety degrees, AS3FCM employs a local consistency strategy to build a regularization term. Meanwhile, two regularization terms are constructed to constrain the outputs of the labeled instances. The constructed regularization terms are then embedded into the objective function of FCM. Finally, an alternating iterative optimization strategy is utilized to solve the optimization problem. In each iteration, the safety degrees can be adaptively computed and updated. To evaluate the performance of our algorithm, some experiments are conducted on toy and several benchmark datasets. As the mislabeled percentages change, AS3FCM can obtain the clustering accuracy from 81.23% to 82.87% on Heart and 86.84% to 88.12% on WDBC while the other S3C methods yield the accuracy from 80.09% to 82.41% on Heart and 86.34% to 87.94% on WDBC. It verifies that AS3FCM can reasonably estimate the safety degrees and achieve a safe exploration of the mislabeled instances. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Fuzzy c-means; Safe semi-supervised clustering; Safety degree,Article,Scopus

To facilitate customer contacts and to reduce the corresponding operating costs, organizations resort to self-service interaction channels. However, dealing with self-service customer support platforms has been identified to be one of the most frustrating aspects of a poor customer contact experience. This paper builds on real data from contact centers of a major U.S. insurance company, covering about 10 million calls, to study transfer rate at the interactive voice-response platform. We develop an empirical model to analyze features that exert significant impact on the likelihood that a call arrived to the platform is eventually transferred to a live agent. We find evidence that caller types, specific caller intents, trying distinct channels, and payment attempts can help predicting the transfer outcome. Our study confirms the importance of a caller's location attribute and evinces that the size and composition of the set of effective features and their directions vary substantially across different states. Our results provide managers with several actionable insights to enhance the customer contact experience. For example, our feature selection analysis enables designing personalized interactive voice-response systems based on customer-contact features. Identifying those calls expected to be transferred at any time can guide recruiting and scheduling a workforce with appropriate skill sets. In addition, the transfer rate is a key input variable for various decision making problems arising in the management of call center operations. © 2022",Big data; Business analytics; Call transfer rate; Contact center; Feature selection; Machine learning; Self-service customer support platform,Article,Scopus

Targeted threats, such as ransomware, cause millions of dollars in losses every year. The constant increase of malware infections has been motivating popular antiviruses (AVs) to develop dedicated detection strategies, which include meticulously crafted machine learning (ML) pipelines. However, malware developers unceasingly change their samples’ features to bypass detection. This constant evolution of malware samples causes changes to the data distribution (i.e., concept drifts) that directly affect ML model detection rates, something not considered in the majority of the literature work. In this work, we evaluate the impact of concept drift on malware classifiers for two Android datasets: DREBIN (?130K apps) and a subset of AndroZoo (?285K apps). We used these datasets to train an Adaptive Random Forest (ARF) classifier, as well as a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifier. We also ordered all datasets samples using their VirusTotal submission timestamp and then extracted features from their textual attributes using two algorithms (Word2Vec and TF-IDF). Then, we conducted experiments comparing both feature extractors, classifiers, as well as four drift detectors (Drift Detection Method, Early Drift Detection Method, ADaptive WINdowing, and Kolmogorov–Smirnov WINdowing) to determine the best approach for real environments. Finally, we compare some possible approaches to mitigate concept drift and propose a novel data stream pipeline that updates both the classifier and the feature extractor. To do so, we conducted a longitudinal evaluation by (i) classifying malware samples collected over nine years (2009–2018), (ii) reviewing concept drift detection algorithms to attest its pervasiveness, (iii) comparing distinct ML approaches to mitigate the issue, and (iv) proposing an ML data stream pipeline that outperformed literature approaches, achieving an improvement of 22.05 percentage points of F1Score in the DREBIN dataset, and 8.77 in the AndroZoo dataset. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Android; Concept drift; Data streams; Machine learning; Malware detection,Article,Scopus

One of the main reasons for this is that it is challenging to build a realistic dataset composed of real-world LR–HR image pairs. However, a domain gap exists between synthetic and real-world data because the degradations in real scenarios are more complicated, limiting the performance in practical applications of SISR models trained with synthetic data. To address these problems, we propose a Self-supervised Cycle-consistent Learning-based Scale-Arbitrary Super-Resolution framework (SCL-SASR) for real-world images. Inspired by the Maximum a Posteriori estimation, our SCL-SASR consists of a Scale-Arbitrary Super-Resolution Network (SASRN) and an inverse Scale-Arbitrary Resolution-Degradation Network (SARDN). SARDN and SASRN restrain each other with the bidirectional cycle consistency constraints as well as image priors, making SASRN adapt to the image-specific degradation well. Meanwhile, considering the lack of targeted training images and the complexity of realistic degradations, SCL-SASR is designed to be online optimized solely with the LR input prior to the SR reconstruction. Benefitting from the flexible architecture and the self-supervised learning manner, SCL-SASR can easily super-resolve new images with arbitrary integer or non-integer scaling factors. Experiments on real-world images demonstrate the high flexibility and good applicability of SCL-SASR, which achieves better reconstruction performance than state-of-the-art self-supervised learning-based SISR methods as well as several external dataset-trained SISR models. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Arbitrary scaling factors; Convolutional neural networks; Real-world image; Resolution-degradation; Self-supervised cycle-consistent learning; Super-resolution,Article,Scopus

To address this issue, we proposed a novel feature selection method, namely non-negative latent factor incorporated duplicate maximal information coefficient (NLF-DMIC), which improves the effectiveness of feature selection for the classification of incomplete data. The NLF-DMIC method is fulfilled by the following three steps: (1) select category-friendly features by MIC based on “partial sample strategy” roughly; (2) use the NLF model to make an imputation for the missing data in terms of the filtered features; and (3) select features again by an improved maximal information coefficient (i.e., low-redundancy MIC, LMIC) method on the complete dataset.

The reliability of the numerically trained classifiers depends on the quality of the training data in terms of the simulation model error contained. Even though FE models can be updated on the intact state for better accordance with the experiment, some model error still remains for most complex structures. This error can limit the ability of generalization to the unmeasured yet damaged experimental states depending on how distinct they are. In the present work, the effect of model error on subsequent classification of experimental damaged states is tested for a lab-scale bridge truss. A Convolutional Neural Network classifier is applied, trained by FE responses. Results show that larger and more distinct damages can be classified with more accuracy compared to small and less distinct, with the latter showing higher prediction bias. The numerical data reliability is found to be reflected on the intact state numerical and experimental feature map shifts. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Damage Identification; Deep Learning; Machine Learning; Structural Dynamics; Structural Health Monitoring; Vibration Measurements,Article,Scopus

Recent technological breakthroughs have increased interest in computer vision-based fire classification that classifies fire and non-fire pixels from image or video datasets. Fire pixels from an image or video can be classified using either a traditional machine learning approach or a deep learning approach. Presently, the deep learning approach is the mainstream in forest fire detection studies. Although deep learning algorithms can handle vast amounts of data, they ignore the variation in complexity among training samples and as a result, their training model performance is limited. Furthermore, deep learning approaches with little data and features perform poorly in real-world challenging fire scenarios. As a result, the current study adopts a machine learning technique to extract higher-order features from the processed images from the publicly available datasets: Corsican dataset and FLAME, and a private dataset: Firefront_Gestosa, for classifying fire and non-fire pixels. It should be emphasized that in machine learning applications, handling multidimensional data to train a model is challenging. Feature selection is used to overcome this problem by removing redundant or irrelevant data that has an impact on the model's performance. In this paper, information-theoretic feature selection approaches are used to choose the most important features for classification while minimizing the computational cost. The traditional machine classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is adopted in the present work, that works on the discriminative features input selected from the feature selection technique. The SVM performs the classification of fire and non-fire pixels with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, and the model's performance is measured using assessment measures such as overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, F-measure, and G-mean. The model draws an overall accuracy of 96,21%, a sensitivity of 94,42%, a specificity of 97,99%, a precision of 97,91%, a recall of 94,42%, an f-measure and g-mean values of 96,13% and 96,19% respectively. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Feature selection; Higher-order features; Radial Basis Function (RBF); Support Vector Machine (SVM); Wildfire,Article,Scopus

Nevertheless, the complexity of this process has limited its widespread adoption, since different part geometries, strategies and boundary conditions can yield very different results in terms of external shapes and inner flaws. Moreover, monitoring part quality during the process execution is very challenging, as direct measurements of both structural and geometrical properties are mostly impracticable. This work proposes an on-line monitoring and prediction approach for LMD that exploits coaxial melt pool images, together with process input data, to estimate the size of a track deposited by LMD. In particular, a novel deep learning architecture combines the output of a convolutional neural network (that takes melt pool images as inputs) with scalar variables (process and trajectory data). Various network architectures are evaluated, suggesting to use at least three convolutional layers. Furthermore, results imply a certain degree of invariance to the number and size of dense layers. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated basing on experiments performed on single tracks deposited by LMD using powders of Inconel 718, a relevant material for the aerospace and automotive sectors. © 2022 The Author(s)",Additive manufacturing; Artificial intelligence; Convolutional neural networks; Laser Metal Deposition; Machine learning; Process quality,Article,Scopus

Automobile brake discs in the production process will inevitably produce unbalance. The unevenness produced by the uneven mass distribution will produce high-frequency vibration in the process of high-speed rotation, which seriously affects the safety of the vehicle and the personal safety of the occupants. The key measure to solve this problem is to correct the unbalance with higher precision before the brake disc leaves the factory. The traditional correction method is to improve the detection accuracy of unbalance to achieve balance accuracy. In this paper, we hope to improve the balance accuracy by compensating for the errors generated in the correction process. We use the random forest model, decision tree model, and support vector machine model to predict the errors of the balancing machine during the calibration process. The main idea is to take the parameters of the brake disc and the features in the milling process as input and the error amplitude as output. The results show that the stochastic forest model has higher prediction accuracy than the decision tree model and support vector machine model. This method can also predict errors from other sources, such as thermal errors. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Brake disc balance; Error prediction; Random forest; Regression,Article,Scopus

Powerful and efficient data-driven approaches have been increasingly employed in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) to extract Damage Sensitive Features (DSFs) from the monitored dynamic response of structures. In this study, a New Generalized Auto-Encoder (NGAE), integrated with a statistical-pattern-recognition-based approach that uses the power cepstral coefficients of structural acceleration responses as DSFs, is proposed for structural damage assessment. This NGAE is well-generalized in the components of cepstral coefficients that represent the structural properties of the entire system thanks to a newly defined encoder-decoder mapping, which largely reduces rid of the data variance attributed to different types of excitations and measurement noise. The cepstral coefficients, by virtue of a compact representation of the structural properties, can greatly simplify the structure of the NGAE, and therefore, significantly accelerate training and inference speeds with very few computational requirements. Two specific evaluation metrics that relates to the autoencoder signal reconstruction error are defined and used to assess the presence of damage. The proposed method has been validated through numerical simulations and experimental data, and shows better performance compared to a Traditional Auto-Encoder (TAE) and the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). © 2022",New generalized autoencoder; Power cepstral coefficients; Statistical pattern recognition; Structural damage assessment,Article,Scopus

Flexible assembly lines are significantly more complex to plan compared to sequential lines. Therefore there is an increased need for autonomously generating flexible robot-centered assembly plans. The novel Autonomous Constraint Generation (ACG) method presented here will generate a dynamic assembly plan starting from an initial assembly sequence, which is easier to program. Using a physics simulator, variations of the work-cell configurations from the initial sequence are evaluated and assembly constraints are autonomously deduced. Based on that the method can generate a complete assembly graph that is specific to the robot and work-cell in which it was initially programmed, taking into account both part and robot collisions. A major advantage is that it scales only linearly with the number of parts in the assembly. The method is compared to previous research by applying it to the Cranfield Benchmark problem. Results show a 93% reduction in planning time compared to using Reinforcement Learning Search. Furthermore, it is more accurate compared to generating the assembly graph from human interaction. Finally, applying the method to a real life industrial use case proves that a valid assembly graph is generated within reasonable time for industry. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Assembly graph generation; CAD based planning,Article,Scopus

Existing efforts have been made to approach this problem, such as performing random environmental perturbations in the learning process. However, one cannot guarantee to train with a positive perturbation as bad ones might bring failures to RL.

Data analytics play a significant role to turn data into valuable insights to assist in the weldability certification decision-making for Resistance Spot Welding (RSW) as well. However, to successfully perform the associated data analytics, domain knowledge is essential to construct more ‘sense-making’ analytics models, as often the models cannot properly capture the nuances of the domain and do not properly indicate the relationship among the RSW concepts and parameters. Thus, machine learning models developed from rough experimental data often do not provide models meaningful and sensible to the domain expert. In this article, we employ a recursive approach between the domain experts and data-driven models so that the knowledge of the domain experts can be integrated into the weldability certification decision-making process. An ontology-based semantic knowledge framework supports this recursive communication while helping the experts to instil more confidence in the developed analytics models. The collaborative and recursive approach implemented in this study helps the domain experts to tap into their domain knowledge and form expert opinions using the formalized semantic RSW concepts and decision rules. The expert opinions are then used to learn new knowledge about the RSW domain and transform the RSW datasets by incorporating significant features that were not included in the earlier models. The transformed datasets help us to develop improved machine learning models, which in turn work as a new source of semantic knowledge, as we have discovered through our pilot implementation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Expert knowledge integration; Ontological knowledge; Recursive approach; Resistance spot welding; Weldability certification,Article,Scopus

This paper presents a comparative study of different surrogate modeling techniques for nonlinear dynamic systems. Four surrogate modeling methods, namely, Gaussian process (GP) regression, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, a convolutional neural network (CNN) with LSTM (CNN-LSTM), and a CNN with bidirectional LSTM (CNN-BLSTM), are studied and compared. All these model types can predict the future behavior of dynamic systems over long periods based on training data from relatively short periods. The multi-dimensional inputs of surrogate models are organized in a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model (NARX) scheme to enable recursive prediction over long periods, where current predictions replace inputs from the previous time window. Three numerical examples, including one mathematical example and two nonlinear engineering analysis models, are used to compare the performance of the four surrogate modeling techniques. The results show that the GP-NARX surrogate model tends to have more stable performance than the other three deep learning (DL)-based methods for the three particular examples studied.

Using the trained DPFF, the ns-long MD simulations for various ILs were performed successfully. Combining the error analysis on atomic energy, distribution of bonds and angles, and potential energy, one can prove that the MD simulation with DPFF can describe the force and energy of ILs with ab initio precision. Meanwhile, the analysis of the vibrational spectrum and hydrogen bond suggests that the DPFF can also predict the coupling nature between coulombic and hydrogen bonding interactions within ILs reasonably. Furthermore, the DPFF for ILs is trained to extend to the bulk system.

It has been designed to treat coupled chemical, mechanical, vibrational, and magnetic degrees of freedom to determine ground state and finite temperature properties of crystals. The symmetry of the underlying parent crystal structure is used to enumerate perturbations of the parent crystal structure and generate derivative structures which can be input to first-principles calculations in order to explore the ground state energy landscape. CASM algorithmically constructs cluster expansions that fully couple discrete and continuous degrees of freedom, and generates highly efficient code to evaluate the cluster expansion basis functions. Widely used machine learning methods are integrated for fitting expansion coefficients to first-principle calculations. The fully parameterized cluster expansions can be combined with (kinetic) Monte Carlo methods to calculate finite temperature thermodynamic and kinetic properties. CASM Alloy Manager identifies distinct parent crystal structures in an alloy system, creating individual projects for each, and integrating the results. The integrated infrastructure facilitates the linkage between first-principles statistical mechanics predictions with higher length scale computational methods, such as phase field simulations.

The results indicate that by specifying the valence electron concentration, vacancy formation energy, and mismatch in cohesive energy as input features, a support vector regression model with a radial bias function kernel displays the highest performance among numerous combinations of machine learning models and material features. According to the Shapley additive explanation, the vacancy formation energy and valence electron concentration show a negative correlation with the yield strength above 1.66 eV and 7.60, respectively, and a positive correlation otherwise. The mismatch in the cohesive energy always shows a negative correlation. By utilizing a Bayesian adaptive alloy design, V5Cr16Fe9Co35Ni35 has been identified to have the highest yield strength.

Methods of characterizing these tumours are valuable for improving predictions of their progression and response to treatment. A mathematical model called the proliferation-invasion (PI) model has been used extensively in the literature to model the growth of these tumours, though it relies on known values of two key parameters: the tumour cell diffusivity and proliferation rate. Unfortunately, these parameters are difficult to estimate in a patient-specific manner, making personalized tumour forecasting challenging. In this paper, we develop and apply a deep learning model capable of making accurate estimates of these key GBM-characterizing parameters while simultaneously producing a full prediction of the tumour progression curve. Our method uses two sets of multi sequence MRI in order to produce estimations and relies on a preprocessing pipeline which includes brain tumour segmentation and conversion to tumour cellularity. We first apply our deep learning model to synthetic tumours to showcase the model's capabilities and identify situations where prediction errors are likely to occur. We then apply our model to a clinical dataset consisting of five patients diagnosed with GBM. For all patients, we derive evidence-based estimates for each of the PI model parameters and predictions for the future progression of the tumour, along with estimates of the parameter uncertainties.

By exploiting view-consistency or view-discrepancy among different views, numerous successful multi-view support vector machine models have been proposed. However, existing methods face two challenges. Firstly, most multi-view support vector machine models only consider the consensus principle, but ignore the complementarity principle. How to build a novel model with both principles has not been fully considered. Secondly, most multi-view support vector machine models neglect the robustness when the multi-view dataset is contaminated by the noisy samples, error-prone samples and view-inconsistent samples. Considering that the bounded linear-exponential (BLINEX) loss function possesses elegant merits, i.e., asymmetry and boundedness, developing a robust BLINEX-based model is worth exploring. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a BLINEX-based multi-view learning method called MVASY-BX, which explores the consensus and complementarity information with a between-view co-regularization term and importance weights of two views respectively. The mixed BLINEX loss is designed to make the model robust to noisy samples, view-inconsistent samples and error-prone samples. We solve linear and nonlinear MVASY-BX through the stochastic sub-gradient descent algorithm and the alternating direction method of multipliers respectively. Furthermore, we analyze the generalization error bound via Rademacher complexity. The comprehensive experiments confirm that our proposed model is more competitive than other benchmark methods. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",BLINEX loss function; Consensus and complementary information; Multi-view learning; Robustness; Support vector machine,Article,Scopus

As a by-product, we find two new counter-intuitive phenomena in nonlinear probability framework (optimal strategic framework). The first is that the combination of losing arm and winning arm can make the winning arm achieve a greater coverage probability to win expected reward, which is also referred to “good + bad = better”. The discovery implies that the traditional advice of always pursuing the arm with larger expected reward (i.e., stay on a winner rule) is not optimal in the probability framework. The second is that the combination sequence out of two independent and normal distribution-based arms is not normally distributed if the two arms are different, which is straightforward understood as “mutually independent normal + normal = unnormal”.

Most of the analyses focus on detailed local modelling and measurements which cannot be systematically applied at regional scales for the purposes of water resources management. The aim of this work is to understand the capabilities of five supervised machine learning classifiers of predicting the ecological status of rivers based on land use, climate, morphology, and water management parameters extracted over the river catchments corresponding to the ecological monitoring stations. Moreover, the performances of machine learning classifiers are compared to the results of the canonical correlation analysis. The method is applied to 360 catchments in Tuscany (central Italy) with a median size of 33.6 km2 and a Mediterranean climate. The results show (i) a significant correlation of ecological status with summer climate (i.e., maximum temperatures and minimum precipitation), land use and water exploitation, (ii) an 80 % precision of Random Forest algorithm to predict ecological status and (iii) higher capability of all classifiers to predict at least good ecological status.

The spatial interpolation model first filled the spatial gaps in the Level-2 Himawari-8 hourly AOD product in 0.05° (?5 km) spatial resolution, while the time interpolation model further improved the temporal resolution to 10 min on its basis. A full-coverage AOD dataset of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (PRD) in 2020 was obtained as a practical implementation. The validation against in-situ AOD observations from AERONET and SONET indicated that this new dataset was satisfactory (R = 0.80), and especially in spring and summer. Overall, our ensemble machine-learning model provided an effective scheme for reconstruction of AOD with high spatiotemporal resolution of 0.05° and 10 min, which may further advance the near-real-time monitoring of air-quality in urban areas. © 2022",Aerosol optical depth; Himawari-8; Machine learning; Satellite remote sensing,Article,Scopus

Indonesia possesses the largest share (65 %) of tropical peat carbon, equal to 57.4 Gt C. Human perturbations such as extensive logging, deforestation and canalization exacerbate water losses, especially during dry seasons, when low precipitation and high evapotranspiration rates combine with the increased drainage to lower groundwater levels. Drying and increasing temperatures of the surface peat exacerbate ignition and wildfire risks within the peat soils. As such, it is critically important to know how groundwater levels in peatlands are changing over space and time. In this study, a multilinear regression model as well as two machine learning algorithms, random forest and extreme gradient boosting, were used to model groundwater level over the study period (2010?12) within a peat dome impacted by drainage canals and multiple wildfires in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Although all three models performed well, based on overall fit, spatial modeling of groundwater level results revealed that extreme gradient boosting (R2 = 0.998, RMSE = 0.048 m) outperformed random forest (R2 = 0.997, RMSE = 0.054 m) and multilinear regression (R2 = 0.970, RMSE = 0.221 m) near drainage canals, which are key fire ignition risk locations in the peatlands. Our study also shows that, on average, elevation and precipitation are the most important parameters influencing groundwater level spatiotemporally. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Extreme gradient boosting; Groundwater level; Random forest; Tropical peatland; Wildfire,Article,Scopus

The most commonly used dynamic model for quantifying the reduction by VFS of surface runoff, eroded sediment, pesticides and other pollutants is VFSMOD, which simulates reduction of total inflow (?Q) and of incoming eroded sediment load (?E) mechanistically during the rainfall-runoff event. These variables are subsequently used to calculate the reduction of pesticide load by the VFS (?P). Since errors in ?Q and ?E propagate into ?P, for strongly-sorbing compounds an accurate prediction of ?E is crucial for a reliable prediction of ?P. The most important incoming sediment characteristic for ?E is the median particle diameter (d50). Current d50 estimation methods are simplistic, yielding fixed d50 based on soil properties and ignoring specific event characteristics and dynamics. We derive an improved dynamic d50 parameterization equation for use in regulatory VFS scenarios based on an extensive dataset of 93 d50 values and 17 candidate explanatory variables compiled from heterogeneous data sources and methods. The dataset was analysed first using machine learning techniques (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) as a dimension reduction technique and to identify potential interactions between explanatory variables. Using the knowledge gained, a parsimonious multiple regression equation with 6 predictors was developed and thoroughly tested. Since three of the predictors are event-specific (eroded sediment yield, rainfall intensity and peak runoff rate), predicted d50 vary dynamically across event magnitudes and intensities. Incorporation of the improved d50 parameterization equation in higher-tier pesticide assessment tools with VFSMOD provides more realistic quantitative mitigation in regulatory US-EPA and EU FOCUS pesticide risk assessment frameworks. The equation is also readily applicable to other erosion management problems. © 2022",Global Sensitivity Analysis; Machine learning; Median particle size; Pesticides; Sediment trapping; Vegetated filter strips,Article,Scopus

Target and suspect screening of PFASs was performed to explore their profiles in WWTPs and assess removal efficiency and environmental emissions. In total, 155 and 58 PFASs were identified in WWTPs in China and Africa, respectively; 146 and 126 PFASs were identified in wastewater and sludge, respectively. Novel compounds belonging to per- and polyfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids (PFECAs) and sulfonic acids (PFESAs), hydrogen-substituted polyfluorocarboxylic acids (H-PFCAs), and perfluoroalkyl sulfonamides (PFSMs) accounted for a considerable proportion of total PFASs (?PFASs) in Chinese WWTPs and were also widely detected in African samples. In China, estimated national emissions of ?PFASs in WWTPs exceeded 16.8 t in 2015, with >60 % originating from emerging PFASs. Notably, current treatment processes are not effective at removing PFASs, with 35 of the 54 WWTPs showing emissions higher than mass loads. PFAS removal was also structure dependent. Based on machine learning models, we found that molecular descriptors (e.g., LogP and molecular weight) may affect adsorption behavior by increasing hydrophobicity, while other factors (e.g., polar surface area and molar refractivity) may play critical roles in PFAS removal and provide novel insights into PFAS pollution control.

Given the resistant nature of phytolith to decomposition, PhytOC can represent up to 82 % of total carbon in some soil and sediments even after 2000 years of litter decomposition. Hence, forests with high PhytOC sequestration rates could play a critical role in increasing terrestrial carbon storage. In this study, we quantified the variation in PhytOC concentrations in bamboo leaves, branches and culms with forest types in the Eastern Indian Himalayas as bamboos are efficient accumulator of phytolith and PhytOC due to their fast growth and high biomass accumulation rates. Using nine different machine learning techniques, we also investigated the determinants of PhytOC production in bamboo stands in the study area in India. The results revealed that the PhytOC concentrations in bamboo stands were in the order of leaf (3.0 g kg?1) &gt; culm (1.0 g kg?1) &gt; branch (0.2 g kg?1) across forest types. The highest PhytOC stock (53.8 kg ha?1) was found in bamboo stands in the subtropical pine forests (1900–3500 m elevation), while the lowest (28.0 kg ha?1) was in the tropical evergreen forests (&lt;900 m elevation). Machine learning techniques established a positive correlation of PhytOC content in leaf and total PhytOC content with soil available phosphorus, elevation, total nitrogen, exchangeable potassium, atmospheric humidity, SOC content, CEC and pH. Numerical evaluation criteria and graphic methods identified artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression as the superior techniques with a root mean square error value of 0.52 kg ha?1 and 0.59 kg ha?1 respectively. The results of these two models were found to be better among all the nine machine learning algorithms used. The high PhytOC storage in the bamboo stands in the Indian Himalayan region suggests that forest management could secure a stable carbon sink on a millennial scale. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Bamboo stands; Carbon sequestration; Forest ecosystems; Machine learning; Modelling,Article,Scopus

Traditional site investigation employs geostatistical interpolation methods (GIMs) to predict the distribution of soil pollutants after soil sampling and chemical analysis. However, the heterogeneity of soil pollution in brownfields makes the assumptions of GIMs no longer valid and further undermines the accuracy of soil investigation. In the present study, a satellite hyperspectral image processing and machine learning method was developed to map arsenic pollution at a brownfield site. To eliminate the noise caused by atmospheric factors and increase the efficiency of spectral data, 1.3 million spectral indexes (SIs) were constructed and 1171 of them were selected due to their high correlations with soil arsenic. Five machine learning methods, i.e., Random forest (RF), ExtraTrees, Adaptive Boosting, Extreme Gradient Trees, and Gradient Descent Boosting Trees (GDB) were built to predict soil arsenic. The RF method was found to render the best performance (r = 0.78), reducing 30 % of prediction errors compared with traditional GIMs. RF also maintained a relatively higher level of accuracy (r = 0.56) when the sampling grids increased to 100 m, which was higher than that of GIMs under a 50 m sampling grid (r = 0.42), revealing that the proposed method can provide more accurate results with fewer sampling points, namely less investigation cost. It was indicated that the second derivate was the most efficient preprocessing method to remove spectral noise and normalized difference (ND) was the most reliable spectral index construction strategy. Based on uncertainty analysis, the heterogeneity of soil arsenic distribution was considered the most influential factor causing prediction errors. This study demonstrates that machine learning based on satellite visible and near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (VNIR) is a promising approach to map soil arsenic contamination at brownfield sites with high accuracy and low cost. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Arsenic contamination; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Satellite hyperspectral imagery; Soil pollution,Article,Scopus

Herein, a cyanobacterial prediction model was designed for Lake Taihu based on a machine learning method. This method can generate temporally continuous (24 moments throughout the day) cyanobacterial data at a fine spatial scale of 9 km. The hourly meteorological data for 24 moments of the day were obtained from ERA5-Land data. Areal coverage of cyanobacterial blooms was derived from the hourly Geostationary Ocean Color Imager reflectance data observed only eight times a day (from ~8:00 to ~15:00, UTC+8). The cyanobacterial and meteorological data of eight moments in Lake Taihu from 2011 to 2020 were used to design the prediction model. The results were compared and validated employing nine training strategies to determine the best cyanobacterial prediction model for Lake Taihu (R = 0.42; root mean square error = 0.10). With the best-fitted model utilizing meteorological data (2011–2020), the area coverage of cyanobacterial blooms at the other 16 moments during a day were estimated. Based on this, the regional and temporal characteristics of diurnal bloom variation were evaluated at an hourly scale. The results indicated that the hourly variations in the areal coverage of cyanobacterial blooms at 24 moments of the day had similar patterns in each subregion of Lake Taihu with minor seasonal variations. The six meteorological variables adopted to construct the model had similar diurnal changes but with diverse value ranges among the seasons. Further analysis revealed that three meteorological variables (temperature, surface pressure, and evaporation) were positively related to diurnal bloom variations at an hourly scale. Overall, these results illustrate that meteorological conditions can affect the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms at multiple time scales (e.g., hourly, daily, or monthly).

Many machine-learning-based retrieval models have been established for estimating various kinds of air pollutants. These methods mainly aimed to estimate a single pollutant (single-pollutant approach). However, different air pollutants interact with each other and are highly correlated. Building a unified model and conducting a joint retrieval of multiple pollutant can make a better use of these connections and improve the model efficiency. This study proposed a physics-informed multi-task deep neural network (phyMTDNN) for the joint retrieval of six main air pollutants, i.e., PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3. The relationships among these pollutants were used to design the physics-informed network structure and loss function. Top-of-atmosphere reflectance which can generate retrieval results at ultrahigh resolution was used as model input. Experiments for mainland China in 2019 showed that the proposed model successfully achieved simultaneous estimation of six air pollutants, with the cross-validated R2 for the six pollutants varying from 0.72 to 0.90. The contrast experiments proved that physics-informed network structure contributed to the most of the model performance improvement. Compared to the single-pollutant approach, phyMTDNN ameliorated the model accuracy on traces gases retrieval. Furthermore, the modeling efficiency was largely improved in that a lot of repetitive work was avoided and modeling method was optimized.

The reasonability of the selected optimal scheme was confirmed by assessing the consistency between its generating AGPP and previous products in spatiotemporal variations and total amount. Random forest regression tree explained 85 % of observed AGPP variations, outperforming other machine learning algorithms and classical statistical methods. Variable combinations containing climate, soil, and biological factors showed superior performance to other variable combinations. Mapping AGPP through predicting AGPP per leaf area (PAGPP) explained 86 % of AGPP variations, which was superior to other approaches. The optimal scheme was thus using a random forest regression tree, combining climate, soil, and biological variables, and predicting PAGPP. The optimal scheme generating AGPP of Chinese terrestrial ecosystems decreased from southeast to northwest, which was highly consistent with previous products. The interannual trend and interannual variation of our generating AGPP showed a decreasing trend from east to west and from southeast to northwest, respectively, which was consistent with data-oriented products. The mean total amount of generated AGPP was 7.03 ± 0.45 PgC yr?1 falling into the range of previous works.

Candidate predictors namely sentinel-2 spectral bands, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI), digital elevation model (DEM), slope and aspect were used as the input variables to estimate SM. An intensive field survey had been done to gather in-situ SM data using a time-domain reflectometer (TDR). K-fold validation based on in-situ SM measurements demonstrated the reasonability of the SM estimation of the proposed methodology. Detecting homogeneous areas was done using genetic and particle swarm optimization algorithms. Synthesized SM product of PSO-GMDH showed a mean Normalized Root-Mean-Square Error (NRMSE) of 13.6 to 8.91 for global and local approaches in the test phase.

Microcystis aeruginosa (Ma), the dominant species in global freshwater cyanobacterial blooms, produces exudates (MaE) that cause adverse outcomes including nerve damage. Previously, we identified > 300 chemicals in MaE. It is critical to investigate neurotoxicity mechanisms of active substances among this suite of Ma compounds. Here, we screened 103 neurotoxicity assays from the ToxCast database to reveal targets of action of MaE using machine learning. We then built a potential Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) to identify neurotoxicity mechanisms of MaE as well as key targets. Finally, we selected potential neurotoxins matched with those targets using molecular docking. We found 38 targets that were inhibited and eight targets that were activated, collectively mainly related to neurotransmission (i.e. cholinergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmitter systems). The potential AOP of MaE neurotoxicity could be caused by blocking calcium voltage-gated channel (CACNA1A), because of antagonizing neurotransmitter receptors, or because of inhibiting solute carrier transporters. We identified nine neurotoxic MaE compounds with high affinity to those targets, including LysoPC(16:0), 2-acetyl-1-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, egonol glucoside, polyoxyethylene (600) monoricinoleate, and phytosphingosine.

We used bootstrap ensemble ML methods to develop CL estimates and assess uncertainties of CLs for the growth and survival of 108 tree species in the conterminous United States.

Using four statistical methods, we quantified the uncertainty of CLs in 95 % confidence intervals (CI). At the lower bound of the CL uncertainty estimate, 80 % or more of tree species have been impacted by nitrogen deposition exceeding a CL for tree survival over >50 % of the species range, while at the upper bound the percentage is much lower (<20 % of tree species impacted across >60 % of the species range).

Water testing data indicates there is arsenic contamination in private drinking water wells across New Jersey. To reduce the adverse health risk due to exposure to arsenic in drinking water, it is necessary to identify arsenic sources affecting private wells. Private wells are not regulated by any federal or state agencies through the Safe Drinking Water Act and therefore information is often lacking. To this end, we have developed machine learning algorithms including Random Forest Classification and Regression to decipher the factors contributing to higher arsenic concentration in private drinking water wells in west-central New Jersey. Arsenic concentration in private drinking water wells served as a response variable while explanatory variables were geological bedrock type, soil type, drainage class, land use/cover, and presence of orchards, contaminated sites, and abandoned mines within the 152.4-meter (500 ft) radius of each well. Random Forest Classification and Regression achieved 66 % and 55 % prediction accuracies for arsenic concentration in private drinking water wells, respectively. Overall, both models identify that bedrock, soil, land use/cover, and drainage type (in descending order) are the most important variables contributing to higher arsenic concentration in well water. These models further identify bedrock subgroups at a finer scale including Passaic Formation, Lockatong Formation, Stockton Formation contributing significantly to arsenic concentration in well water. Identification of sources of arsenic contamination in private drinking water wells at such a fine scale facilitates development of more targeted outreach as well as mitigation strategies to improve water quality and safeguard human health. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Arsenic; Bed rock; Human health; Private well water; Random Forest Classification; Random Forest Regression,Article,Scopus

Results reported here demonstrate that ensemble models showed significantly better predictive performance than traditional models.

Increasing evidence has shown that vascular cognitive impairment has a significant correlation with vascular risk factors. Therefore, vascular risk factors can be used to identify and predict vascular cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical value of support vector machine model in the recognition of vascular mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI) based on vascular risk factors, which is expected to be used as a screening tool in grassroots institutions, communities and home rehabilitation. METHODS: Participants enrolled in the study were assessed for cognitive function and then divided into three groups: normal group, VaMCI group, and dementia group. Vascular risk factors with statistically significant differences were selected by analysis of variance among the three groups. The factors mentioned above were used to build the support vector machine model for screening VaMCI. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under curve were used to evaluate the predictive performance of the model. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: In the study, 80 participants enrolled were assessed for cognitive function and then divided into three groups: normal group (39 cases), VaMCI group (24 cases), and dementia group (17 cases). Systolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and blood uric acid were observed to be significantly different among the three groups (P < 0.05) and they were therefore used to construct the prediction model. The sensitivity, specifi, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of screening for VaMCI were 0.845 3, 0.919 4, 0.818 0, and 0.932 7, respectively and the area under the receiver operating curve was 0.892 3. To conclude, the support vector machine model has high diagnostic value in VaMCI screening based on vascular risk factors, and it is simple and easy to operate and can be applied to grassroots institutions, communities and home rehabilitation. © 2023, Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

Fluid. Mech.,2(3), 1956, pp.237–262) suggested that the functional form of the drag coefficient (CD) of a single sphere subjected to uniform fluid flow consists of a series of logarithmic and power terms of the Reynolds number (Re). In this paper, we will explore the validity of the above statement for Reynolds numbers up to 106 by using a symbolic regression machine learning method. The algorithm is trained by available experimental data and data from well-known correlations from the literature for Re ranging from 0.1 to 2×105. Our results show that the functional form of CD contains powers of log(Re), plus the Stokes term. The logarithmic CD expressions can generalize (extrapolate) better beyond the training data than pure power series of Re and are the first in the literature to predict with acceptable accuracythe onset of the rapid decrease (drag crisis) of CD at high Re, but also to follow the right behaviour towards zero Re. We also find a connection between the root of the Re-dependent terms in the CD expression and the first point of laminar separation. The generalization behaviour of power-based drag coefficient equations is worse than logarithmic-based ones, especially towards the zero Re regime in which they give non-physical results. The logarithmic based CD correctly describes the physics from the low Re regime to the onset of the drag crisis. Also, by applying a minor modification in the logarithmic based equations, we can predict the drag coefficient of an oblate spheroid in the high Re regime. © 2022 The Authors",Drag coefficient; Machine learning; Matched asymptotic expansions; Multi-phase flows; sphere,Article,Scopus

Two types of dimensionless models were identified for each spray target property from the 75 experimental points considered. The first type used a conventional monomial-exponential shape equation, and the second applied shape identification through machine-learning. Although conventional models of the first type were mostly satisfactory when considering the characteristic diameters, they nevertheless showed clear limitations addressed by the machine-learning identified models. The conventional approach also failed to identify a satisfactory equation for the polydispersity index. The machine-learning approach provided an equation identifying this index to the main dimensionless parameters governing atomization. This identification provides a foundation for proposing a two-parameters dimensionless model that predicts spray particle size distribution. The combination of dimensional analysis with machine-learning equation identification thus paves the way to physically rigorous and easy-to-use models capable of predicting characteristic properties and full distributions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Atomization; Bifluid nozzle; Dimensional analysis; Droplet size distribution modeling; Machine learning modeling,Article,Scopus

The concept of connectivity matrix is employed to represent a molecule structure. An extraction strategy is proposed to extract a plethora of submatrices (or molecular structural fragments) with each representing the environment of an atom/bond automatically and systematically from this connectivity matrix. This extraction does not cause any loss of molecular information. The submatrices are then transferred into molecular features based on matrix eigenvalues. Frequency and Pearson correlation analysis are used to extract key features, which are further reduced using principal component analysis. Machine-learning methods such as the artificial neural network (ANN) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) are used to develop prediction models, respectively.

Many recent advances in this area have raised questions about estimating consumers’ preferences when they partially ignore the information provided in discrete choice experiments, a problem introduced as attribute non-attendance (ANA). This line of research explores the consequences of assuming that consumers consider all available information concerning attributes to evaluate product alternatives, when in fact, they might ignore some attributes completely. Diverse choice models, such as latent class models, have been developed to accommodate ANA using choice data. Due to the combinatorial nature of such an approach, researchers typically explore a limited number of specifications. Furthermore, although diverse modeling approaches have been proposed to accommodate ANA, no research has investigated the capability of these approaches to correctly identify ANA at the individual level. In this work, we propose the use of a machine learning approach based on support vector machines to identify ANA at the individual level and to predict consumer choices in conjoint experiments. We conduct an extensive simulation study varying the degree of non-attendance and the noise in the choice data to investigate the performance of the proposed approach. Our results with simulated data show good performance in terms of the identification of attended and non-attended attributes.

Using the enhanced ISA methodology with MFP as the case study, this paper demonstrates that the most important features can be detected, and machine learning methods can identify their impact on algorithm performance, whilst reducing the bias caused by over-representation within the selected sample of test instances. The enhanced methodology enables new insights into the performance of state-of-the-art general purpose MFP algorithms, as well as recommendations for the construction of comprehensive and unbiased benchmark test suites for MFP algorithm testing. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Feature selection; Instance selection; Instance space analysis; Maximum flow; Validation of OR computations,Article,Scopus

Moreover, it identifies key influencing factors and their effects based on the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm. The results show that the districts with low terrestrial NPP show the characteristics of agglomeration distribution. The eight key factors, in order, are as follows: agricultural development level, latitude, population size, longitude, animal husbandry development level, economic scale, time trend and industrialization level. In this study, via SHAP interaction plots, we found that the effects of population, economic growth, and industrialization on terrestrial NPP are regionally heterogeneous; via cluster analysis, we found the stage characteristics of the mode of SED affecting terrestrial NPP.

The SEC method integrates the semi-supervised regression, extreme learning machine, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Wind loads on a group of buildings are sensitive to many influencing factors, and there are not sufficient enough wind tunnel test samples for machine learning prediction. SEC uses semi-supervised regression to construct pseudo-labeled samples of untested buildings and mixes them with existing samples to expand training samples to improve the prediction precision. Wind tunnel tests demonstrate that peak wind loads sometimes have a strong relationship with the building spacing or alter rapidly with the variation of building spacings. CFD can calculate mean wind loads much more accurately than peak wind loads at low costs. SEC adds mean wind loads of untested buildings simulated by CFD as the input variable in the prediction model to weaken the nonlinear relationship between the input variables and peak wind loads and further improve the prediction accuracy. The results of the case study of a group of three flat-roof buildings show that the prediction performance of the SEC model using 2891 existing wind tunnel test samples reaches that of the extreme learning machine model using 5782 existing wind tunnel test samples when the predicted target is in the local range where peak wind loads alter rapidly with the increase of the building spacing. The prediction performance of the SEC model is improved with the increase in the number of pseudo-labeled samples. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",A group of buildings; Computational fluid dynamics; Extreme learning machine; Peak wind loads; Semi-supervised learning,Article,Scopus

Structural health monitoring (SHM) systems were widely deployed in most long-span bridges, providing long-term measurements of wind characteristics and vibrations of girders and towers. This paper proposes a data-driven approach to predict the vibration amplitudes of girder and towers for early warning based on state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. A cable-stayed bridge with a main span of 1088 m is taken as the case study. The monitoring data during a strong typhoon Haikui are extracted to establish the database for training the machine learning models. Wind speed, wind direction, and turbulence intensity are selected as input variables, and girder and tower vibrations are considered as the output. Vertical and lateral vibrations are predicted for the girder, while in-plane and out-of-plane vibrations for the tower. Random Forest (RF) is used for vibration prediction and has demonstrated better accuracy than other typical algorithms. An integrated girder vibration indicator is proposed for early warning considering vertical and lateral directions. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is used to approximate the distribution of the vibration indicator with Akaike information criterion (AIC). The early warning is implemented with monitoring data and predicted results. The proposed approach can guide the bridge operator to manage and maintain bridges during typhoon events and avoid bridge damage and traffic accidents due to excessive vibration. © 2022 The Author(s)",Cable-stayed bridge; Early warning; Girder and tower vibration; Machine learning; Probability density function; Structural health monitoring,Article,Scopus

Despite progress in PINN research, large gradients and highly nonlinear patterns remain challenging to model. Thin boundary layer problems are prominent examples of large gradients that commonly arise in transport problems. In this study, boundary-layer PINN (BL-PINN) is proposed to enable a solution to thin boundary layers by considering them as a singular perturbation problem. Inspired by the classical perturbation theory and asymptotic expansions, BL-PINN is designed to replicate the procedure in singular perturbation theory. Namely, different parallel PINN networks are defined to represent different orders of approximation to the boundary layer problem in the inner and outer regions. In different benchmark problems (forward and inverse), BL-PINN shows superior performance compared to the traditional PINN approach and is able to produce accurate results, whereas the classical PINN approach could not provide meaningful solutions. BL-PINN also demonstrates significantly better results compared to other extensions of PINN such as the extended PINN (XPINN) approach. The natural incorporation of the perturbation parameter in BL-PINN provides the opportunity to evaluate parametric solutions without the need for retraining.

However, the prediction accuracy of general machine learning models is limited due to a limited number of model hyperparameters and their dedicated application domains. The artificial neural network (ANN) model can significantly improve the prediction accuracy. At the same time, it suffers from the well-known curse of dimensionality issue (i.e., the amount of required training data increases exponentially with input feature dimensions). In this work, a novel alloy design strategy through a Gated recurrent unit (GRU) deep learning model, orthogonal experimental design and data augmentation technique was developed. Under the case of orthogonal experimental design and data augmentation, the GRU model, compared with the regular feed-forward neural network model, reduced the amount of training data required for accurate prediction and dramatically improved model prediction accuracy. The experimental results further verified that the GRU model exhibited the best prediction accuracy in the case of data augmentation and orthogonal experimental sampling. In addition, the prediction trend of GRU model and the analysis results of orthogonal experiment indicated the main factors affecting yield strength were HD (Hot rolling deformation), CD (Cold rolling deformation), AT (Aging temperature), the main factors affecting conductivity were AT (Aging temperature), At (Aging time). Finally, a high strength and high conductivity Cu-Ni-Si alloy with a tensile strength of 923 MPa, a yield strength of 685 MPa, and electrical conductivity of 47.2% IACS was predicted by using 36 experimental data through the strategy.

The model combines two important techniques. The first technique is to visualize the fluctuation of the daily load of natural gas through the classical GARCH family model. and characterize the fluctuation through parameters.

These two sub-neural networks are connected according to the model of buffeting response in the frequency domain to output the predicted spectrum of response. Sub-neural networks are constructed by bi-directional gated recurrent unit neural networks for their capacity of modeling complex mappings among sequences.

In such structures, punching shear failure is often critical. This type of failure is brittle and occurs without pronounced advance notice, and the alternative load paths cannot be ensured. Therefore, this failure can lead to progressive collapse. For this reason, proper reliability assessment of slabs against punching is of great importance. Improved accuracy and minimization of uncertainty in the predictive models are critical. Currently, there is a wide debate in the international community about the best predictive model for punching shear capacity and there is no clear consensus among researchers. This study focuses on the development of predictive models for punching shear capacity of concrete structures using machine learning (ML) algorithms such as the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The models were developed using a set of 501 experimental punching shear tests from existing theses, dissertations, technical papers, and research reports. The performance of the developed prediction model is evaluated statistically and by comparison with EC 2. Based on the soft computing approach of the ML model, it is possible to achieve precise and accurate prediction of the ultimate punching shear capacity with significant speed. Thus, this method is suitable for implementation in probabilistic models in a reliability framework. And it can be used to explore parameter sensitivities of the punching shear failure mechanism. The results of this study indicate that the Gaussian Process Regression and specifically the Matern 5/2 algorithm can describe very accurately the punching shear capacity and it is suitable for probabilistic evaluations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Flat slabs; Gaussian process regression; General probabilistic model; Machine learning; Punching shear capacity; Reliability,Article,Scopus

Therefore, several researchers have modeled and mapped its occurrence and distribution in soils. Nonetheless, leveraging model predictive performances while coupling information derived from visible near-infrared (Vis-NIR) and soils (i.e. chemical properties) to estimate potential toxic elements (PTEs) like Zn in agricultural soils is largely untapped. This study applies two methods to rapidly monitor Zn concentration in agricultural soil. Firstly, employing Vis-NIR and machine learning algorithms (MLAs) (Context 1) and secondly, applying Vis-NIR, soil chemical properties (SCP), and MLAs (Context 2). For the Vis-NIR information, single and combined pretreatment methods were applied. The following MLAs were used: conditional inference forest (CIF), partial least squares regression (PLSR), M5 tree model (M5), extreme gradient boosting (EGB), and support vector machine regression (SVMR) respectively. For context 1, the results indicated that M5-MSC (M5 tree model-multiplicative scatter correction) with coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.72, root mean square error (RMSE) = 21.08 (mg/kg), median absolute error (MdAE) = 13.69 and ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ) = 1.63 was promising. Regarding context 2, CIF with spectral pretreatment and soil properties [CIF-DWTLOGMSC + SCP (conditional inference forest-discrete wavelet transformation-logarithmic transformation-multiplicative scatter correction-soil chemical properties)] yielded the best performance of R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 14.52 (mg/kg), MdAE = 6.25 and RPIQ = 1.78. Altogether, for contexts 1 and 2, the CIF-DWTLOGMSC + SCP approach (context 2) was the best Zn model outcome for the agricultural soil.

To extract global information, one usually needs a large window size, a large number of layers, and/or a large number of channels. This can often significantly increase the computational cost. In this work, we present a novel neural network layer that directly incorporates long-range information for a point cloud. This layer, dubbed the long-range convolutional (LRC)-layer, leverages the convolutional theorem coupled with the non-uniform Fourier transform. In a nutshell, the LRC-layer mollifies the point cloud to an adequately sized regular grid, computes its Fourier transform, multiplies the result by a set of trainable Fourier multipliers, computes the inverse Fourier transform, and finally interpolates the result back to the point cloud. The resulting global all-to-all convolution operation can be performed in nearly-linear time asymptotically with respect to the number of input points. The LRC-layer is a particularly powerful tool when combined with local convolution as together they offer efficient and seamless treatment of both short- and long-range interactions. We showcase this framework by introducing a neural network architecture that combines LRC-layers with short-range convolutional layers to accurately learn the energy and force associated with a N-body potential. We also exploit the induced two-level decomposition and propose an efficient strategy to train the combined architecture with a reduced number of samples. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Long-range interactions; Neural network; Non-uniform fast Fourier transform; Point cloud,Article,Scopus

Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly applied to grain yield with remote sensing data. However, the performance of individual ML algorithms varies for different species in different environments due to different sources of uncertainty. This study proposed a novel wheat yield prediction framework based on canopy hyperspectral reflectance (350–2500 nm) and adopted the ensemble Bayesian model averaging (EBMA) method to improve model performance. To develop the yield prediction models, important bands extracted by the Boruta feature selection method were fed into four linear ML models and four nonlinear ML models. Meanwhile, Bayesian model averaging (BMA) weights obtained based on model cross-validation performance were used to combine the predictions of individual ML models. Compared to the best-performing individual model, the EBMA models obtained a weak accuracy improvement by integrating only the linear models or the nonlinear models. Additionally, the integration of two linear models and two non-linear models simultaneously was analyzed. Results indicate that most EBMA combinations of mixed linear and non-linear models achieved higher prediction accuracy than those integrating a single type of model and the best-performing individual model. The advantage of the EBMA method is that it produces a prediction distribution that reflects the uncertainty associated with deterministic predictions.

This approach applies to discrete (particle-based) systems and continuous systems that can be recast as a particle problem by a framework like Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. The governing equations are written as a set of equations describing the motion of the particle system. Artificial Neural Networks are used to derive from data the forces acting on the particles, while the system's path in the state-space is calculated with the equation of motion. This ensures that fundamental physical principles such as Newton's laws of motion are always satisfied in a strong sense. Neighbour lists automatically introduce dimensionality reduction into the system by functioning as physics-optimized convolutions. Therefore, the network can be smaller, simpler, and more easily trainable than other physics-informed machine learning models. The proposed technique is applied to three inverse modelling problems. The method is designed to learn the pairwise forces acting between particles without knowing these forces from the training data. In fact, the training data contains the total force acting on each particle, not the pairwise forces between pairs of particles. Data for Molecular Dynamics, Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics and Discrete Element Method simulations are fed into the model that ‘extracts’ their physics and reproduces the simulations with a high degree of accuracy. The model's capability for generalization is noteworthy. As long as the underlying physics remains the same, the model can predict the dynamics of systems with geometries and boundary conditions very different from those of the training dataset. As a remarkable example, a model trained surface-flow data also correctly replicates channel flow. © 2022 The Author(s)",Discrete element method; Molecular dynamics; Physics-informed machine learning; Smoothed particle hydrodynamics,Article,Scopus

Recently, label-free imaging flow cytometry has been deeply investigated in cell recognition. In particular, the combination of flow cytometry and machine learning allows for achieving high accuracy in cell identification and high throughput. Despite the encouraging results, the potentialities of digital holography (DH) in flow-cytometry modality have not been exploited in full. Up to now, only 2D phase maps have been used in all previously reported research about the use of DH for analyzing flowing cells. Here we show that having access to the whole 3D information of each flowing cell can improve the cells identification. We used digital holographic flow cytometry to collect images of flowing cells and reconstructed their 3D tomographic phase. And for the first time, we extracted scores of meaningful morphometric features from the 3D and 2D phase maps through machine learning methods and finally compare their classification performance. The results show that 3D features can achieve higher classification accuracy with respect to sole 2D analysis demonstrating that 3D morphology information can yield advantages in recognizing drug-resistant endometrial cancer cells, thus allowing a significant step forward in performance of label-free cell classification. © 2022",Cancer cells; Holographic tomography; Imaging flow cytometry; Label-free 3D microscopy; Machine Learning,Article,Scopus

Despite their ability to produce highly accurate predictions, MHD models require computationally intensive high-dimensional simulations. This renders them inadequate for making time-sensitive predictions and for large-ensemble analysis required in uncertainty quantification. This paper presents a new data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) capability for forecasting heliospheric solar wind speeds. Traditional model reduction methods based on Galerkin projection have difficulties with advection-dominated systems—such as solar winds—since they require a large number of basis functions and can become unstable. A core contribution of this work addresses this challenge by extending the non-intrusive operator inference ROM framework to exploit the translational symmetries present in the solar wind caused by the Sun's rotation. The numerical results show that our method can adequately emulate the MHD simulations and is more accurate than a reduced-physics surrogate model, the Heliospheric Upwind Extrapolation model. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Data-driven model reduction; Magnetohydrodynamics; Operator inference; Scientific machine learning; Solar wind modeling; Space weather prediction,Article,Scopus

We developed a novel method for the identification of closely related medicinal plants using a machine learning (ML)-based electrochemical fingerprinting platform. Firstly, the system featured a bare glassy carbon electrode capable of recording the voltammetric response of active components in medicinal plants as electrochemical fingerprints. Subsequently, different algorithms and various datasets were employed to analyze the correlation between the above electrochemical fingerprint data and the medicinal plant species. As a proof-of-concept, 6 species of Anoectochilus roxburghii (A. roxburghii) were selected as the verification samples. The electrochemical fingerprints of the samples were measured by differential pulse voltammetry in two buffer solutions. Thereafter, four powerful ML algorithms were utilized for the identification of A. roxburghii with different datasets. The results showed that the accuracy of identifying species reached 94.4 % by the nonlinear support vector machines based on the slope data of electrochemical responses in two buffer solutions, evidencing the successful discrimination of closely related medical plants by this method.

Personalized clinical decision making could shorten depressive episodes and reduce patient suffering. Although no clinical tools are currently available, machine learning analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) shows promise in treatment response prediction. Methods: With a systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluated the accuracy of EEG for individual patient response prediction. Importantly, we included only prediction studies that used cross-validation. We used a bivariate model to calculate prediction success, as expressed by area-under the curve, sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, we analyzed prediction success for separate antidepressant interventions. Results: 15 studies with 12 individual patient samples and a total of 479 patients were included. Research methods varied considerably between studies. Meta-analysis of results from this heterogeneous set of studies resulted in an area under the curve of 0.91, a sensitivity of 83 % (95 % CI 74–89 %), and a specificity of 86 % (95 % CI 81–90 %). Classification performance did not significantly differ between treatments. Although studies were all internally validated, no externally validated studies have been reported. We found substantial risk of bias caused by methodological shortcomings such as non-independent feature selection, though performance of non-biased studies was comparable. Limitations: Sample sizes were relatively small and no study used external validation, increasing the risk of overestimation of accuracy. Conclusions: Electroencephalography can predict the response to antidepressant treatment with high accuracy. However, future studies with more rigorous validation are needed to produce a clinical tool to guide interventions in MDD.

In this paper, we propose short- and medium-term wind power forecasting systems targeted to the Nordic energy market, which integrate inputs on the wind flow conditions from three numerical weather prediction sources. A point forecasting scheme is adopted, which forecasts the power at the individual turbine level. Both direct and indirect forecasting approaches are considered and compared. An automated machine-learning pipeline, built and optimized using genetic programming, is implemented for developing the proposed forecasting models. The turbine level power forecasts using different approaches are then combined into a single forecast using a weighting method based on recent forecast errors. These are then aggregated for the wind farm level power estimates. The proposed forecasting schemes are implemented with data from a Norwegian wind farm. We found that in both the direct and indirect forecasting approaches, the forecasting errors could be reduced between 8% and 22%, while inputs from several NWP sources are used together. The wind downscaling model, which is used in the indirect forecasting approach, could significantly contribute to the model's accuracy.

Nuclear power source, as a clean energy that is easy to be stored, has been rapidly developed in the past few decades. Because uranium is the main nuclear fuel, mining uranium from seawater is essential. Besides, uranium-containing wastewater discharged by nuclear industry also pose a serious threat for ecological environment. Considering the radioactivity and toxicity of uranium, it is urgent for us to remove U(VI) from wastewater. To achieve these ends, various uranium adsorption materials have been developed. Among them, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have aroused wide concern owing to the advantages of high specific surface areas, abundant active adsorption sites and controllable pore structure. However, there is huge room for MOFs and COFs in the application of uranium treatment. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review on MOFs and COFs for the enrichment and removal of U(VI) from seawater and wastewater, including synthetic approach, influencing factors, possible adsorption mechanism, as well as the performance comparison with other materials. In addition, the problem of current research is pointed out and the future direction about MOFs and COFs in uranium treatment is discussed.

The multi-dimensional time series is initially decomposed into different intrinsic mode functions simultaneously by the noise-assisted multivariate empirical mode decomposition method. After reconstructing the decomposed series into high-frequency, low-frequency, and trend modules, the extreme learning machine optimized by the cosine-based whale optimization algorithm is proposed to predict the carbon price.

To this aim, in situ data from the Tara Mediterranean Expedition are combined with environmental and Lagrangian diagnostics in a machine learning approach to produce spatially-explicit maps of plastic debris and zooplankton abundance. We then analyse the plastic to zooplankton ratio in regions with high abundances of pelagic fish. Two of the major hotspots of pelagic fish, located in the Gulf of Gabès and Cilician basin, were associated with high ratio values. Finally, we compare the plastic to zooplankton ratio values in the Pelagos Sanctuary, an important hotspot for marine mammals, with other Geographical Sub-Areas, and find that they were among the larger of the Western Mediterranean Sea.

The key principle is that a change in the relationship between a strain sensor and its neighbors indicates the presence of damage. After defining a sensor grid with sensor locations and their orientation, the relationship can be obtained from numerical simulations of the healthy structure. Here, local regression models are estimated between each master sensor and its neighboring sensors. Then, residuals of the predicted and measured strains are evaluated using a random forest classifier. The evaluation of the residuals has the advantage that the method is independent of the load level, as well as the fact that it is independent of certain environmental influences that are uniformly distributed over the entire structure. In addition to the numerical healthy strains, synthetically generated damage data are used for training the classifier. The synthetic data are obtained by statistical modifications of the healthy strains. This procedure avoids time-consuming and expensive damage simulations. The health monitoring approach is applied to a glass fiber reinforced polymer sandwich structure, imitating an aircraft spoiler, with a hole in the face layer considered as damage. The validation is performed by numerical finite element simulations as well as physical experiments under random loading conditions. The results demonstrate the high potential of the presented approach for strain-based structural health monitoring in composite sandwich structures. © 2022 The Author(s)",Composite sandwich structure; Machine learning (ML); Random forest (RF); Strain-based damage indicator; Structural health monitoring (SHM),Article,Scopus

A multi-objective optimization strategy was proposed to optimize the process parameters for vertical zone refining of 7N-grade ultra-high purity indium (In) by using machine learning (ML). Firstly, classification models were established for certain impurities (Si, S, Fe, Zn, Ni, Cu and As). In these models, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was introduced to overcome the sample imbalance problem of the experimental dataset. The accuracy of these classification models reached above 0.9. Secondly, a ridge regression model was built to predict the total impurity content in the product. The root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.023, the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was 0.91, and R-squared (R2) value was 0.79. Using these models, high-throughput virtual screening was performed to conduct vertical zone-refining experiments, which in turn validated the reliability of the models. Feature analysis by Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) revealed that the total impurity content in the final product strongly depended on the content of Ni and Sn impurities in the 6N-grade indium raw material and on the velocity parameter of the 2rd through 4th zone passes (V2). A lower V2 is favorable for eliminating impurities from indium raw material with total impurity content ranging from 0.2 ppm to 0.4 ppm. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",High-purity indium; Machine learning; Multi-objective optimization strategy; Vertical zone refining,Article,Scopus

The method utilizes two 1D convolutional neural networks to determine the pith location and detect the surface annual rings at multiple cross-sections along the scanned board. The automatically extracted rings and pith information can then be used to estimate the annual ring profile at each cross-section.

To effectively address such problems, this paper proposes a systematic framework to analyse the reliability of energy supply in IESs, considering the dynamics of IESs and the inter-relationships among uncertainties. First, based on the linepack-based performance analysis model of IES, a quasi-steady-state model is established to model the dynamic behaviours in IESs, properly accounting for practical engineering and operational strategies. Then, considering the inter-correlations among different uncertainty sources and time-dependent relationships of each variable, a model that combines the statistical structure of copula with the machine learning method of stacked autoencoder (CSML) is adopted to establish the timely multivariate joint distributions for variables. Monte Carlo simulation combined with Order Statistics is used for assessing supply reliability. Case studies are performed on a realistic IES that combines an IEEE-15 power system with an 18-node natural gas pipeline network. The efficiency and accuracy of the quasi-steady-state model are validated. The reliability evaluation results show that the inter-correlations among variables and time-dependent relationships of each variable have great effects on the system reliability assessment.

In each case, our approach consists in specifically and incrementally studying the benefits of using wind data of the surrounding stations. We show that, at all horizons ranging from 1 to 6 h ahead, the relative gain on the RMSE of the predicted wind speed can increase up to 20 %.

Moreover, the spatiotemporal relationships between compound HEIPs and ecosystem variances were quantified. The framework including DLMCAA showed a good performance in simulating landcover in 2020, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.89.

In particular, the DLMCAA indicated that compound HEIPs had a more positive impact on ecosystem oases in arid lands compared with that of single HEIPs. The results of this study can serve as a scientific reference for assessing the impact of HEIPs, as well as for understanding ecosystem changes and facilitating sustainable water resource management in the arid regions. © 2022",Arid zones; Deep learning-meta cellular automata algorithm (DLMCAA); Ecosystem variation; Hydraulic Engineering Infrastructure Projects (HEIPs); Tarim River Headwaters-Hotan River Basin,Article,Scopus

Digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques are widely accepted for the geospatial analysis of the soil properties. They are rapid and cost-efficient approaches that can provide quantitative prediction. However, the digital mapping of soil pH and CaCO3 are not well studied, especially at a continental scale. In this research, we mapped the soil pH and CaCO3 at the European scale using multisource environmental variables and machine learning approaches. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products, terrain attributes, and climatic variables were considered. Meanwhile, nine machine learning algorithms, namely, three linear and six nonlinear models, were used for the spatial prediction of soil pH and CaCO3. The land use and cover area frame statistical survey (LUCAS) 2015 topsoil dataset provided by the European Soil Data Centre was utilised. The performances of different models were compared and analysed in terms of coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD). Specifically, nonlinear machine learning models outperformed the linear ones, and extremely randomized trees (ERT) gave the most satisfactory result for soil pH (R2 = 0.70, RMSE = 0.75, and RPD = 1.84) and CaCO3 (R2 = 0.53, RMSE = 93.49 g/kg, and RPD = 1.46). The results revealed that MODIS products and climatic variables were important in predicting soil pH and CaCO3. Moreover, spatial distribution of soil pH and CaCO3 in Europe were mapped at 250 m resolution, and the areas with high CaCO3 content always showed high soil pH value. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Digital soil mapping; LUCAS; Model comparison; Soil properties; Spatial prediction,Article,Scopus

This technique has been widely used in the fields of quantitative determination and substance content analysis. However, for complex NIR spectral data, most traditional machine learning models cannot carry out effective quantitative analyses (manifested as underfitting; that is, the training effect of the model is not good). Small amounts of available data limit the performance of deep learning-based infrared spectroscopy methods, while the traditional threshold-based feature selection methods require more prior knowledge. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a competitive adaptive reweighted sampling method based on dual band transformation (DWT-CARS). DWT-CARS includes four types in total: CARS based on integrated two-dimensional correlation spectrum (i2DCOS-CARS), CARS based on difference coefficient (DI-CARS), CARS based on ratio coefficient (RI-CARS) and CARS based on normalized difference coefficient (NDI-CARS). We conducted comparative experiments on three datasets; compared to traditional machine learning methods, our method achieved good results, demonstrating that this method has considerable prospects for the quantitative analysis of near-infrared spectroscopic data. To further improve the performance and stability of this method, we combined the idea of integrated modeling and constructed a partial least squares model based on Monte Carlo sampling for the samples obtained by CARS (DWT-CARS-MC-PLS). Through comparative experiments, we verified that the integrated model could further enhance the accuracy and stability of the results. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Competitive adaptive reweighted sampling; Deep learning; Dual-band transformation; Machine learning; Near infrared spectroscopy analysis,Article,Scopus

Currently, most research works use generic off-the-shelf machine learning models to model reactor behavior. Such models frequently face problems related to data limitations, dynamics, model accuracy, and model interpretability. Considering the increasing need for data-driven models, especially in the fine chemicals and pharmaceutical industry, this work presents a new machine learning model architecture specially for the dynamic modeling of general flow reactors.

To this end, this study evaluated the flood susceptibility using a neural network model depending on a flood inundation map created from satellite data from 2010 to 2020, and explanatory factors for flood inundation selected by Geodetector and regularized random forest. Subsequently, the landscape pattern of the coastal city was quantified based on the land cover, and key landscape pattern metrics for flood susceptibility were selected at patch and class levels using statistical approaches. Eventually, urban spatial planning strategies for flood management were proposed based on the ecological significance of key metrics. Taking Xiamen as a case study, the flood susceptibility map showed that flood-prone areas in Xiamen are mainly distributed along river banks and coastlines. Key landscape pattern metrics for flood susceptibility selected by statistical approaches showed that patch-level metrics account for more explanatory power than class-level metrics, and the classes of the landscape would affect the role of patch-level metrics. Overall, the division index of the forest, the connectance index of water, the number of core areas and the fractal dimension index of urban, and the Euclidean nearest-neighbor distance of urban and water are significantly positively related to flood susceptibility, while the core area and the proximity index of urban, the similarity index, the core area index, and the edge contrast index of the forest, and the contiguity index of forest, grass, farmland, and shrub negatively related with flood susceptibility.

Different morphotypes of the pacu Piaractus mesopotamicus (elliptical and rounded) have been described previously and may represent different commercial trends. Therefore, this study aimed to 1) develop a computer vision system (CVS) through deep learning that targets the prediction of morphometric measurements and body shape (morphotypes) in pacu, 2) analyze whether morphotypes vary according to the environment, sex, and/or age, and 3) estimate genetic parameters for body shape, using the condition factor (K) and ellipticity (E) as criteria. Data from 1380 individuals corresponding to 48 full-sib families were evaluated in two distinct environments (breeding nucleus: env1; commercial fish farm: env2). The animals were evaluated based on their weight and morphometric measurements at 15 and 28 months of age (growth stage). We used the mask R-CNN model as a deep-learning algorithm, which was optimized for a ResNet architecture with only 18 layers. This resulted in a faster training period (8GB NVIDIA 2060 RTX in less than a day), which requires less computational effort. The pacu CVS was effectively developed to account for the segmentation of several fish body regions (head, body, fins, and pelvis), as corroborated by the high correlations of measurements predicted manually and automatically. We detected K and E variation at different growth stages and environments, in which fish tend to have rounded shapes in env2 and at 28 months old. The body shape heritability indicates that this trait is under moderate genetic control and should respond to selection. In conclusion, this study established an efficient CVS for pacu that is resilient to field conditions, allowing high-throughput phenotyping for the routine assessment of body shape in breeding programs for this species. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Artificial intelligence; Genetic selection; Phenomics,Article,Scopus

In this study, we proposed a co-pyrolysis strategy to optimize the gasification reactivity of DS to realize rapidly and efficiently converting DS into syngas. The co-pyrolysis feedstocks were DS and rapeseed cake (RC) under the carbonization temperatures of 800 °C and 1000 °C, followed by being gasified at 850–950 °C to estimate the gasification characteristics and kinetics. The results indicated the gasification reactivity of RC char was markedly higher than that of DS char, thereby with the potential to facilitate biochar reactivity of DS. The co-pyrolytic char reactivity obtained at temperature of 800 °C was enhanced with the elevated RC ratio but was all lower than that of mono-pyrolysis char, whereas the gasification reactivity of biochar pyrolyzed in 1000 °C was continuously strengthened as the DS ratio decreased from 100 % to 0. The kinetic results also indicated the apparent activation energy were increased with adding more proportion of DS, which resulted in a higher energy barrier to initialize the gasification reaction. The carbon arrangement was a critical key factor to modify the biochar reactivities, from which the large amounts of amorphous carbons and defects were promoted the biochar reactivity of RC char, whereas the ordered arrangement of crystallites for DS char was scarcely conducive to the diffusion effects of gasifying agents in carbon atoms and further diminishing the gasification reactivity. Furthermore, machine learning (ML) algorithm was for the first time adopted to simulate the co-gasification characteristics as a function of reaction time and blend ratios, and presented a higher consistency with experimental data, indicating the potential value of ML in predicting the co-gasification behaviors. Our findings can provide a feasible strategy to recover DS waste in a clean and efficient pathway, and layer a foundation for further perfecting the biomass refinery system to match the upstream production with downstream waste processing. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Gasification reactivity; Kinetics; Machine learning; Physicochemical properties; Waste management,Article,Scopus

However, in real-world industrial scenarios, obtaining adequate high-quality label information is typically challenging and unrealistic, resulting in the performance degradation of most existing supervised learning-based diagnosis models, and necessitating the development of unsupervised intelligent diagnostic models. In addition, the sample independence hypothesis is widely used in existing studies, which significantly ignores the further mining of relevant auxiliary information between samples and its positive effect on performance improvement. To overcome these challenges, a novel intelligent fault diagnosis framework, called the convolutional capsule auto-encoder-based unsupervised directed hierarchical graph network with clustering representation (CCAE-UDHGN-CR), is established and employed in unlabeled scenarios. First, a novel convolutional capsule auto-encoder (CCAE), which combines reconstruction loss and semantic clustering loss, is constructed and used to extract deep coding features that contain attribute information of the sample itself. Then, with the assistance of cosine similarity measurement strategy, the internal correlation between samples is fully mined, and on this basis, the conversion of deep coding features to the graph sample set is realized, which serves as the input of the subsequent unsupervised directed hierarchical graph network (UDHGN). Finally, the deep representation features extracted by the UDHGN are further fed into the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) model to complete the determination of category information. A total of three cases based on key functional components and manipulator are employed for performance verification. The comprehensive diagnosis results all show that the proposed CCAE-UDHGN-CR model can effectively alleviate the dependence on label information while maintaining excellent diagnosis performance. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Capsule neural network; DBSCAN clustering; Graph convolution network; Intelligent fault diagnosis; Unsupervised learning,Article,Scopus

Within this field, among the several methods proposed in the literature to diagnose damage affecting thin-walled structures, satisfactory performances have been achieved by adopting tomographic algorithms to process ultrasonic guided waves, even though with some limitations. Recently, such limitations have been overcome by adopting machine learning-based algorithms, even though their implementation in real life applications is still limited because of the mistrust in neural networks determined by their black box-like nature. To date, however, several explainability algorithms have been proposed to interpret the behaviour of neural networks, in particular in the medical and in the military fields, where trust in the tools adopted must be guaranteed. Thus, exploiting the potentialities of explainability frameworks, in this work the layer-wise relevance propagation algorithm is employed to explain the predictions of convolutional neural networks for classification and for regression that characterise damage by processing ultrasonic guided waves excited and sensed by means of a 2-D network of piezoelectric devices. First, the explainability algorithm is applied to give a score to each sample of the acquired ultrasonic guided waves, then such scores are collected by means of a properly developed aggregation strategy to rank the most informative couples of piezoelectric devices. The capabilities of the explainable damage diagnosis framework are demonstrated by means of a numerical, yet realistic, case study involving a metal plate affected by crack-like damage. In particular, the focus is set on the explanation of the behaviour of the neural networks involved, with the aim of building trust in such algorithms and, possibly, revealing damage-related hidden features of ultrasonic guided waves. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",CNN; Explainable AI; LRP; SHM; Ultrasonic guided wave,Article,Scopus

However, a machine often has specific operating conditions for different tasks, which will cause significant divergence in its measurements. Generally, planned maintenance or model-based fault detections can be done first to collect very few suspension histories when the machine works in a new environment. Few suspension histories can help the prognostic model generalize to new environments. This paper proposes a transductive method to use limited suspension histories in transfer prognostics. Different from reported cross-domain prognostics that only align two-domain histories in a holistic manner, the proposed domain adaptation strategy simultaneously minimizes the distance between both marginal and conditional probability distributions in different domains. If the measurements have a clear degradation manifold, iterative learning will allow the model to get better and better pseudo predictions, thus guiding the prognostic model to learn generalized domain invariant features to deal with different working conditions. A heuristic method and a parallel framework are proposed to verify model parameters and uncertainties. The prognostic performance of the proposed approach is validated by using two case studies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Domain adaptation; Remaining useful life prediction; Suspension history; Transfer learning,Article,Scopus

PTELM is to seek two projection directions in the TELM feature space, such that the projected samples of one class are well separated from those of the other class. Compared with the PTSVM, PTELM tackles nonlinear cases without using several fixed kernel functions, thus PTELM is less sensitive to use specified parameters and can get better classification accuracy. Then, a new capped L1-norm PTELM (CL1-PTELM) is proposed by introducing capped L1-norm distance metric in PTELM to reduce the effect of outliers. CL1-PTELM overcomes the disadvantages of L2-norm distance metric and hinge loss. Thus, CL1-PTELM enhances the robust performance of our PTELM. Finally, two effective algorithms are designed to solve the problem of PTELM and to deal with the challenge of CL1-PTELM brought by non-convex optimization problem, respectively.

In this paper, we propose to exploit the fact that the agents seek to improve their expected cumulative reward and introduce a novel Time Dynamical Opponent Model (TDOM) to encode the knowledge that the opponent policies tend to improve over time.

However, in realistic scenarios, the explosive increase of distributed data promotes the widespread application of the cloud–edge–client architecture, but also brings a variety of security threats. Relying on the advantages of federated learning technology, this has led to a growing interest in federated learning as the intersection of machine learning and cloud–edge–client fields. However, recent studies found that federated learning is potentially vulnerable to data poisoning attacks. Existing explorations of federated learning poisoning attacks and defense techniques in the cloud–edge–client environment are largely attack capabilities-specific and privacy protection-based: they are designed but fail to consider the characteristics of federated learning vulnerability and the difference in attack intensity, and lack flexibility. Yet few different attack capabilities and general defense strategies have been developed. To address these concerns, we introduce federated cloud–edge–client learning collaborative framework. Based on this architecture, a client-launched multi-label flipping attack method is discussed, which exhibits different attack capabilities. Further, we propose SPAD, a Server-based Parameter Adaptive Defense method in response to different attack intensities, to identify malicious attackers and benign participants, thereby improving the security of the federated learning image classification task. The results on image classification tasks demonstrate that in cloud–edge–client scenario, the multi-label flipping attack method presents different degrees of poisoning effect, and SPAD method has strong feasibility and effectiveness against poisoning attacks, which verify the significant advantages of the proposed method. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Cloud–edge–client framework; Data poisoning; Defense; Federated learning; Multi-label flipping attack,Article,Scopus

Also, the proposed approach aims to maintain the manifold of data using locally alignment constrains. The main goal of these suggestions is to discriminate different classes while reducing the redundancy of the samples specially for the imbalanced data classification problems. The proposed approach optimizes a hybrid objective function that tries to both increase the between class discrimination and decrease the within class distribution while minimizing the information loss. Also, we have embedded a weighting factor into the objective function to achieve a basis for feature importance measurement and feature selection. To evaluate the proposed approach, a multiclass linear SVM classifier is applied on the reduced data in a k-fold cross-validation scheme, and the accuracy, as well as F-score, is used as the performance measure.

FJSS schedules the operations of jobs to be executed by specific machines at the appropriate time slots based on two decision steps, namely, the job sequencing (i.e., the sequence of jobs executed on a machine) and the job routing (i.e., the route of a job to a machine). Most current studies utilize either deep reinforcement learning (DRL) or multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for FJSS with a large search space. However, these studies suffer from two major limitations: no integration between DRL and MARL, and independent agents without cooperation. To this end, we propose a new model for FJSS, called DeepMAG based on Deep reinforcement learning with Multi-Agent Graphs. DeepMAG has two key contributions. (1) Integration between DRL and MARL. DeepMAG integrates DRL with MARL by associating a different agent to each machine and job. Each agent exploits DRL to find the best action on the job sequencing and routing. After a job-associated agent chooses the best machine, the job becomes a job candidate for the machine to proceed to its next operation, while a machine-associated agent selects the next job from its job candidate set to be processed. (2) Cooperative agents. A multi-agent graph is built based on the operation relationships among machines and jobs. An agent cooperates with its neighboring agents to take one cooperative action. Finally, we conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of DeepMAG and experimental results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Deep learning; Deep Q networks; Flexible job shop scheduling; Multi-agent graphs; Reinforcement learning,Article,Scopus

Our literature review investigates all research papers on grooming detection in online conversations by looking at the psychological definitions and aspects of grooming. We study the psychological theories behind the grooming characteristics used by machine learning models that have led to predatory stage detection. Our survey broadly considers the authorship profiling research works used for grooming detection in online conversations, along with predatory conversation detection and predatory identification approaches. Various approaches for online grooming detection have been evaluated based on the metrics used in the grooming detection problem. We have also categorized the available datasets and used feature vectors to give readers a deep knowledge of the problem considering their constraints and open research gaps.

To date, most drift compensation strategies have focused on classification accuracy, while neglecting the labelling cost in the real-world. To simultaneously improve classification accuracy and reduce labelling cost, we propose a novel drift compensation framework for gas sensors, which combines cross-domain subspace learning with balanced distribution and cross-domain adaptive extreme learning machine (CSBD-CAELM). First, in a common subspace, the marginal distribution and conditional distribution between the source domain (clean data) and target domain (drift data) are adaptively aligned, which reduces the distribution divergence between domains. Then, the proposed CSBD-CAELM learns a robust classifier by leveraging the guide samples. Finally, both the subspace and the classifier are optimized continually by iteratively refining the soft labels of the target domain. In this way, a dual drift compensation effect combining the feature level and classifier level is achieved. Compared with the existing methods based on transfer samples, the labelling cost is reduced. The experimental results show that, at the same labelling cost, the CSBD-CAELM can improve the accuracy by 19.5% and 26.4% in the long-term drift scenario and short-term drift scenario, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Cross-domain adaptive extreme learning machine; Labelling cost; Sensor drift; Soft labels; Subspace learning,Article,Scopus

It has been treated as an indicator which reveals the privacy leakage of machine learning models. In this work, we aim to understand the advantage achieved by White-box MIA, and defend against White-box MIA. Firstly, we estimate the KL divergence on the hidden layers’ features between training set and test set as the internal generalization gap. By comparing the internal generalization gap and the generalization gap on the output layer, we raise two insights including (1) the existence of larger generalization gaps on hidden layers and (2) feasibility of generalization gap minimization in defending White-box MIA. Based on our insights, we further design a novel defense method named Nirvana. It intentionally minimizes generalization gap to defend White-box MIA. Formally, Nirvana works by selecting a hidden layer with large generalization gaps and executing a multi-samples convex combination among features on the layer during the training to defend against White-box MIA. Finally, we empirically evaluate Nirvana with state-of-the-art defense methods on CIFAR100 dataset, Purchase100 dataset, and Texas dataset. The experiment results show that Nirvana achieves a trade-off between utility and privacy. It can defend both White-box MIA and Black-box MIA while the test accuracy of the model is maintained.

Benefiting from the strong reliability, the pollution sources are revealed by the VOC network and supported by the joint mobile sampling of a vehicle-mounted gas chromatography–mass spectrometry system.

During the last decades of cancer research, lifestyle and random/genetic factors have been blamed for cancer mortality, with obesity, sedentary habits, alcoholism, and smoking contributing as supposed major causes. However, there is an emerging consensus that environmental pollution should be considered one of the main triggers. Unfortunately, all this preliminary scientific evidence has not always been followed by governments and institutions, which still fail to pursue research on cancer's environmental connections. In this unprecedented national-scale detailed study, we analyzed the links between cancer mortality, socio-economic factors, and sources of environmental pollution in Italy, both at wider regional and finer provincial scales, with an artificial intelligence approach. Overall, we found that cancer mortality does not have a random or spatial distribution and exceeds the national average mainly when environmental pollution is also higher, despite healthier lifestyle habits. Our machine learning analysis of 35 environmental sources of pollution showed that air quality ranks first for importance concerning the average cancer mortality rate, followed by sites to be reclaimed, urban areas, and motor vehicle density. Moreover, other environmental sources of pollution proved to be relevant for the mortality of some specific cancer types. Given these alarming results, we call for a rearrangement of the priority of cancer research and care that sees the reduction and prevention of environmental contamination as a priority action to put in place in the tough struggle against cancer. © 2022 The Authors",Cancer; Environment; Italy; Machine learning; Mortality; Pollution,Article,Scopus

With freely available Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, we mapped for the first time polyethylene silage bags used for forage conservation in a year with the Random Forest algorithm, and proposed them as a spatial indicator of cattle intensity. For this, we combined monthly silage area with land cover and climatic variables in a regression framework to understand cattle intensity metrics at regional and farm scales throughout 20 million hectares in the Dry Chaco. In addition, we explored the impact of using maize silage supplementation on productive and environmental metrics at the farm scale in a precipitation gradient. We validated our models using a spatially explicit database of cattle distribution. Our results highlight that silage bags are accurate mappable objects with Sentinel-2, which can contribute to the understanding of cattle density, and heifer and steer density in pasture contexts at farm and regional scales. Finally, our whole-farm simulations support the idea that incorporating silage supplementation in cattle ranching regional analyses conducts to significant differences on environmental or productive estimations, which should be considered. The amount of stored forage that is used in supplementation has strong implications for the performance of cattle ranching, but remains difficult to quantify at the regional level with remote sensing. Silage bag mapping is thus an opportunity to improve the overall understanding of livestock intensification and its productive and environmental impacts, particularly in highly seasonal rangelands. Following this metric could be a valuable indicator of the cattle ranching performance in terms of it resilience, production increase and impacts over natural ecosystems (related to Sustainable Development Goal 2-zero hunger and also in the 15-life on land). © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Agricultural plastic; Cattle ranching intensification; Machine learning object detection; On farm-storage; Strategic supplementation,Article,Scopus

In developing countries such as China, however, the cohort evidence was extremely rare. In this study, we aimed to establish the concentration-response relationship between long-term exposure to NO2 and mortality in Chinese adults. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study followed up from 2011 to 2018, by enrolling 15,440 participants aged ?45 years from 28 provincial regions of China. NO2 concentration estimates were derived from high-quality spatiotemporal datasets developed by machine learning methods and were assigned for each participant according to their residential cities. We applied Cox proportional hazard models with time-varying exposures to assess the association of all-cause death with long-term NO2 exposure. Subgroup analyses were performed to identify effect modifications. Results: A total of 1646 death events occurred during 105,478.5 person-years' follow-up (median 7.1 years). No evident violation for linear NO2-mortality relationship (P nonlinear = 0.332) was observed at a range of 7.4–45.0 ?g/m3. Per 10-?g/m3 rise in NO2 was associated with an hazard ratio of 1.220 (95% confidence interval: 1.103–1.350) for all-cause mortality. The association between NO2 and mortality was generally robust after adjusting for co-pollutants including fine particulate matter or/and ozone. Only participants aged 65 and over (1.351 [1.193–1.531]) suffered from increased risks of death associated with NO2 exposure, and an evident effect modification by age (P = 0.008) was identified. The elevated risk of death induced by NO2 was also observed in participants living in rural areas and those with elementary school education or below, though effect modifications were non-significant in these subgroups. Conclusions: This study provided novel evidence that long-term NO2 exposure could be an independent risk for mortality among Chinese middle-aged and older adults.

Experimental measurements are laborious and based on semi-empirical equations, while Bondi's group contribution theory involves ambiguities like the determination of van der Waals volume and the choice of factor values in the theoretical equation. To efficiently evaluate the FFV of polymers, this study utilizes high-throughput molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to build a large dataset regarding polymer's FFV. Based on this large dataset, we further build machine learning (ML) models to establish the composition-structure relation. Inspired by group contribution theory which correlates polymer's functional groups to FFV, our ML models correlate polymer's sub-structures or physico-chemical indexes to FFV. Our study first benchmarks the MD simulation protocol to obtain reliable FFV of polymers and then carries out high-throughput MD simulations for more than 6500 homopolymers and 1400 polyamides. Such a large and diverse dataset makes the well-trained ML models more generalizable, compared with the group contribution theory. The efficiency of a feed-forward neural network model is further demonstrated by applying it to a hypothetical polyimide dataset of more than 8 million chemical structures. The predicted FFVs of hypothetical polyimides are further validated by MD simulations. The obtained FFVs of the 8 million polymers, plus their previously reported gas separation performances, demonstrate the promising capability of ML virtual screening for the discovery of polymer membranes with exceptional permeability/selectivity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Fractional free volume; Machine learning; Molecular dynamics simulation; Polymer membrane; Virtual screening,Article,Scopus

This review article provides an overview of evolutionary-based optimization techniques with a special focus on Genetic Algorithms (GA's) and their potential use in the catalyst design process. The ‘descriptors’ required to design catalysts via evolutionary-based optimization techniques are discussed explicitly for five key chemical reactions, namely, the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR), the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER), the Nitrogen Reduction Reaction (NRR), and the CO2 Reduction Reaction (CO2RR).

As a developed superalloy in aerospace, the liquid structure and nucleation mechanism of Ti-Al alloy desire to be investigated to comprehend the solidification process deeply. This work develops an accurate deep neural network (DNN) potential for Ti-Al binary system by employing a machine-learning method. Then, the local structure and the nucleation process of liquid Ti-48 %Al and Ti-52 %Al (atomic percentage) alloys from the normal to the undercooled state are performed by molecular dynamics simulation with the DNN potential. It is found that the formation of the locally ordered structures depends on the Ti-Al atom pair during the solidification. The Honeycutt-Andersen indices of 1431,1541 and 1551 are dominant, and the liquid structure is mainly characterized by perfect and distorted icosahedral clusters. By Voronoi Polyhedron (VP) analysis, Ti-centered VPs favor the formation of body-centered-cubic (BCC) structure, while Al-centered VPs have the main contribution to the icosahedral structure. Besides, liquid Ti-52 %Al alloy prefers to form face-centered-cube (FCC) nuclei than BCC nuclei in a high undercooling, which is closely related to the ability to capture Ti-Al bonds. The favor of the nucleation of the ? phase causes the nuclei with non-equilibrium composition, comprised of Ti-rich BCC and Al-rich FCC coordinated atoms, respectively. Novelty, the FCC nuclei in liquid Ti-Al alloys are independently generated without the precursor of BCC coordinated atoms. High undercooling can transform the nucleation mechanism from two steps to one step. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Liquid alloy; Machine-learning method; Nucleation; Solidification; Ti-Al alloy,Article,Scopus

Identifying the factors that affecting phytoextraction efficiency has important application value in guiding the efficient remediation of heavy metal contaminated soil. However, it is challenging to identify the critical factors that affect the phytoextraction of heavy metals in soil–hyperaccumulator ecosystems because the current projections on phytoremediation extrapolations are rudimentary at best using simple linear models. Here, machine learning (ML) approaches were used to predict the important factors that affecting phytoextraction efficiency of hyperaccumulators. ML analysis was based on 173 data points with consideration of soil properties, experimental conditions, plant families, low-molecular-weight organic acids from plants, plant genes, and heavy metal properties. Heavy metal properties, especially the metal ion radius, were the most important factors that affect heavy metal accumulation in shoots, and the plant family was the most important factor that affect the bioconcentration factor, metal extraction ratio, and remediation time. Furthermore, the Crassulaceae family had the highest potential as hyperaccumulators for phytoremediation, which was related to the expression of genes encoding heavy metal transporting ATPase (HMA), Metallothioneins (MTL), and natural resistance associated macrophage protein (NRAMP), and also the secretion of malate and threonine. New insights into the effects of plant characteristics, experimental conditions, soil characteristics, and heavy metal properties on phytoextraction efficiency from ML model interpretation could guide the efficient phytoremediation by identifying the best hyperaccumulators and resolving its efficient remediation mechanisms. © 2022",Heavy metal; Hyperaccumulator; Machine learning; Phytoextraction; Soil remediation,Article,Scopus

In order to realize rapid non-destructive testing of hotpot oil quality, a modeling experiment method of fluorescence hyperspectral technology combined with machine learning algorithm was proposed. Five preprocessing algorithms were used to preprocess the original spectral data, which realized data denoising and reduces the influence of baseline drift and tilt. The feature bands extracted from the spectral data showed that the best feature bands for the two-classification model and the six-classification model were concentrated between 469 and 962 nm and 534–809 nm, respectively. Using the PCA algorithm to visualize the spectral data, the results showed the distribution of the six types of samples intuitively, and indicated that the data could be classified. Based on the modeling analysis of the feature bands, the results showed that the best two-classification models and the best six-classification models were MF-RF-RF and MF-XGBoost-LGB models, respectively, and the classification accuracy reached 100 %. Compared with the traditional model, the error was greatly reduced, and the calculation time was also saved. This study confirmed that fluorescence hyperspectral technology combined with machine learning algorithm could effectively realize the detection of reused hotpot oil. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Feature selection; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Hotpot oil; Nondestructive testing; Visual display,Article,Scopus

Except for material properties, eco-friendliness and energy savings gained increasing concern during concrete production. This paper proposed a framework for mixture proportions optimization of RAC based on machine learning and metaheuristics. Six machine learning models were developed to predict the compressive strength of RAC based on a dataset with 1305 samples. With the best prediction model, three scenarios with four objective functions including compressive strength, materials cost, carbon footprint, and energy intensity of RAC were optimized using the competitive mechanism-based multi-objective particle swarm optimization (CMOPSO) algorithm. Results show all machine learning models can predict the compressive strength of RAC with high accuracy, among which the extreme gradient boosting model shows superior performance over other models. The curing age, cement content, and replacement ratio of recycled coarse aggregate are dominant features influencing the compressive strength of RAC. The CMOPSO algorithm can obtain the Pareto optimal solutions in three design scenarios. The proposed framework improves the efficiency in optimizing the mixture design of RAC for achieving required mechanical, economic, and environmental objectives. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Machine learning; Metaheuristics; Mixture design; Multi-objective optimization; Recycled aggregate concrete,Article,Scopus

In our previous work (Huang et al. in J Comput Phys 453:110941, 2022), we proposed an approach to learn the gradient of the unclosed high order moment, which performs much better than learning the moment itself and the conventional PN closure. However, while the ML moment closure has better accuracy, it is not able to guarantee hyperbolicity and has issues with long time stability. In our second paper (Huang et al., in: Machine learning moment closure models for the radiative transfer equation II: enforcing global hyperbolicity in gradient based closures, 2021. arXiv:2105.14410), we identified a symmetrizer which leads to conditions that enforce that the gradient based ML closure is symmetrizable hyperbolic and stable over long time. The limitation of this approach is that in practice the highest moment can only be related to four, or fewer, lower moments. In this paper, we propose a new method to enforce the hyperbolicity of the ML closure model. Motivated by the observation that the coefficient matrix of the closure system is a lower Hessenberg matrix, we relate its eigenvalues to the roots of an associated polynomial. We design two new neural network architectures based on this relation. The ML closure model resulting from the first neural network is weakly hyperbolic and guarantees the physical characteristic speeds, i.e., the eigenvalues are bounded by the speed of light. The second model is strictly hyperbolic and does not guarantee the boundedness of the eigenvalues. Several benchmark tests including the Gaussian source problem and the two-material problem show the good accuracy, stability and generalizability of our hyperbolic ML closure model. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Hyperbolicity; Machine learning; Moment closure; Neural network; Radiative transfer equation,Article,Scopus

The limited availability of data has largely constrained the artificial intelligence (AI) system development to facilitate this literature reviewing in the regulatory process. In the past decade, AI has revolutionized the area of text mining as many deep learning approaches have been developed to search, annotate, and classify relevant documents. After the great advancement of AI algorithms, a lack of high-quality data instead of the algorithms has recently become the bottleneck of AI system development. Herein, we constructed two large benchmark datasets, Chlorine Efficacy dataset (CHE) and Chlorine Safety dataset (CHS), under a regulatory scenario that sought to assess the antiseptic efficacy and toxicity of chlorine. For each dataset, ?10,000 scientific articles were initially collected, manually reviewed, and their relevance to the review task were labeled. To ensure high data quality, each paper was labeled by a consensus among multiple experienced reviewers. The overall relevance rate was 27.21% (2,663 of 9,788) for CHE and 7.50% (761 of 10,153) for CHS, respectively. Furthermore, the relevant articles were categorized into five subgroups based on the focus of their content. Next, we developed an attention-based classification language model using these two datasets. The proposed classification model yielded 0.857 and 0.908 of Area Under the Curve (AUC) for CHE and CHS dataset, respectively. This performance was significantly better than permutation test (p < 10E-9), demonstrating that the labeling processes were valid.

They progress slowly and asymptomatically, and thus can cause blindness, if left untreated. Therefore, the importance of early detection and follow-up treatment in the prevention of visual impairments cannot be overstated.

In this study, we propose a computer-assisted diagnostic system with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based stacking ensemble learning (EL) method to detect diabetic macular edema, drusen, and choroidal neovascularization diseases using OCT images. First, fine-tuned AlexNet (FT-CNN) was used to extract features from OCT images. The features were extracted from activation maps and then classified using homogeneous and heterogeneous EL methods. The EL methods were applied to two pub-licly available OCT datasets [Duke spectral domain OCT dataset and California San Diego University (UCSD) OCT dataset].

There are two schools of thought, as to how electrical fields can dissociate gas hydrates: Case 1: gas hydrates are dissociated (unlocked) by an appropriate intensity and frequency of the electric field, Case 2: gas hydrates are dissociated by an appropriate level of Joule heating. In either case, one must resolve the thermoelectric fields within a heterogeneous medium consisting of encapsulated gas hydrates in a interstitial material. Accordingly, the objective of this work is to develop an easy-to-calibrate model and rapid simulation strategy to guide the delivery of an appropriate current and electrical field, as well as an appropriate level of Joule heating. The approach utilizes a coupled system of equations based on: (1) an electrical-flow submodel, (2) a thermal field evolution submodel, (3) a thermoelectric and frequency-dependent attenuation and (4) a spatio-temporal Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD) discretization of the coupled field equations. The model can be rapidly computed and allows analysts to vary parameters quickly, which facilitates the potential use of Machine Learning paradigms for data-model calibration.

Automatic detection of arrhythmia is possible by analyzing a patient's abnormal heartbeats and has become a major research area in recent years, as the manual examination of heart activity is time-consuming and prone to errors. Nowadays, the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) - based algorithms to predict abnormal heartbeats categorized into five classes namely, non-ectopic (N), supra ventricular ectopic (S), ventricular ectopic (V), fusion (F) and unknown beats (Q) has drawn more attention in detecting arrhythmias.

This research was conducted in the south-western coastal zone of Bangladesh, where rice is the main crop and other crops are also grown. Land use and land cover (LULC) classification using remote sensing techniques such as the use of satellite or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images can forecast the crop yield and can also provide information on weeds, nutrient deficiencies, diseases, etc. to monitor and treat the crops. Depending on the reflectance received by sensors, remotely sensed images store a digital number (DN) for each pixel. Traditionally, these pixel values have been used to separate clusters and classify various objects. However, it frequently generates a lot of discontinuity in a particular land cover, resulting in small objects within a land cover that provide poor image classification output. It is called the salt-and-pepper effect. In order to classify land cover based on texture, shape, and neighbors, Pixel-Based Image Analysis (PBIA) and Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) methods use digital image classification algorithms like Maximum Likelihood (ML), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), k-means clustering algorithm, etc. to smooth this discontinuity. The authors evaluated the accuracy of both the PBIA and OBIA approaches by classifying the land cover of an agricultural field, taking into consideration the development of UAV technology and enhanced image resolution. For classifying multispectral UAV images, we used the KNN machine learning algorithm for object-based supervised image classification and Maximum Likelihood (ML) classification (parametric) for pixel-based supervised image classification. Whereas, for unsupervised classification using pixels, we used the K-means clustering technique. For image analysis, Near-infrared (NIR), Red (R), Green (G), and Blue (B) bands of a high-resolution ground sampling distance (GSD) 0.0125m UAV image was used in this research work.

In terms of Kappa statistics, OBIA was 27% more accurate than PBIA, indicating Kappa statistics accuracy of 93.4%. It indicates that OBIA provides better classification performance when compared to PBIA for the classification of high-resolution UAV images.

The Hakanson potential ecological risk index (RI), which considers the effects of heavy metal concentration and toxicity, has been widely used in soil ecological risk assessment. However, RI overlooks the influence of soil properties on the mobility and availability of heavy metals in risk assessment. To fill this gap, this study sought to develop an improved ecological risk index (IRI), which incorporates soil adsorption into RI, and applied it to evaluate the ecological risk of heavy metals in the soil of the Taihu basin, China. The soil adsorption models based on the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) was used to predict the soil adsorption capacity of five heavy metals (i.e. cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, zinc). The soil adsorption capacity in 1446 sites in the Taihu basin was predicted by the GBDT models and was assigned as the weight of IRI. The risk assessment results of the five metals in the Taihu basin showed that 40% of the sites were at a moderate risk level and 60% of the sites were at a slight risk level based on the RI. The value of IRI in the basin ranged from 11.1 to 75.5, with a mean value of 28.1. IRI differed from RI in spatial distribution due to the influence of soil adsorption. The comparative analysis between the metal contents in sediments and surrounding soils confirmed the tremendous influence of soil adsorption on ecological risks, indicating that soil adsorption should be taken into consideration in soil risk assessment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Adsorption capacity; Ecological risk index; Heavy metal; Machine learning; Soil risk assessment,Article,Scopus

The technique addresses some of the drawbacks of conventional 2D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), offering improved sensitivity, more limited experimental variation, and accurate within-gel matching. 2D-DIGE is based on direct labeling of proteins with isobaric fluorescent dyes (known as CyDyes: Cy2, Cy3, and Cy5) prior to isoelectric focusing (IEF). Here, up to two samples and a reference pool (internal standard) can be mixed and loaded onto IEF for first dimension prior to SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate)-PAGE separation in the second dimension. After the electrophoretic run, the gel is imaged at the specific excitation wavelength for each dye, in sequence, and gel scans are recorded separately. For each individual protein spot, intensities recorded at the different wavelengths are integrated and the ratio between volumes normalized to that of the internal standard. This provides an immediate appreciation of protein amount variations under the different conditions tested. In addition, proteins of interest can still be excised and identified with conventional mass spectrometric techniques and further analyzed by other biochemical methods.

Such a new approach provides an opportunity to generate real-time data from water with the noncontact method, largely improving working efficiency. By summarizing the development and current applications of hyperspectral remote sensing, we compare the relative merits of varying remote sensing platforms, popular inversion models, and the application of hyperspectral monitoring of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), transparency, total suspended solids (TSS), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), phycocyanin (PC), total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) water quality parameters. Most studies have focused on spaceborne remote sensing, which is usually used to monitor large waterbodies for Chl-a and other water quality parameters with optical properties; semiempirical, bio-optical, and semianalytical models are frequently used. With the rapid development of aerospace technology and near-surface remote sensing, the spectral resolution of remote sensing imaging technology has been dramatically improved and has begun to be applied to small waterbodies. In the future, the multiplatform linkage monitoring approach may become a new research direction. Advanced computer technology has also enabled machine learning models to be applied to water quality parameter inversion, and machine learning models have higher robustness than the three commonly used models mentioned above.

We developed a novel forecasting methodology that includes data preprocessing and an artificial neural network (ANN) model, which we integrated with a recent nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm [marine predators algorithm (MPA)]. The MPA-ANN algorithm was compared with four nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms. Nine climatic factors were examined with different scenarios to simulate the monthly stochastic urban water demand over 11 years for Baghdad City, Iraq. The results revealed that (1) precipitation, solar radiation, and dew point temperature are the most relevant factors; (2) the ANN model becomes more accurate when it is used in combination with the MPA; and (3) this methodology can accurately forecast water demand considering the variability in climatic factors.

Even though the scientific literature has hinted at the iterative and explorative nature of data science coding, we need further empirical evidence to understand this practice and its workflows in detail. Such understanding is critical to recognise the needs of data scientists and, for instance, inform tooling support. To obtain a deeper understanding of the iterative and explorative nature of data science coding, we analysed 470 Jupyter notebooks publicly available in GitHub repositories. We focused on the extent to which data scientists transition between different types of data science activities, or steps (such as data preprocessing and modelling), as well as the frequency and co-occurrence of such transitions. For our analysis, we developed a dataset with the help of five data science experts, who manually annotated the data science steps for each code cell within the aforementioned 470 notebooks. Using the first-order Markov chain model, we extracted the transitions and analysed the transition probabilities between the different steps. In addition to providing deeper insights into the implementation practices of data science coding, our results provide evidence that the steps in a data science workflow are indeed iterative and reveal specific patterns. We also evaluated the use of the annotated dataset to train machine-learning classifiers to predict the data science step(s) of a given code cell. We investigate the representativeness of the classification by comparing the workflow analysis applied to (a) the predicted data set and (b) the data set labelled by experts, finding an F1-score of about 71% for the 10-class data science step prediction problem. © 2022, The Author(s).",Data science; Data science life cycle; Data science workflow; Data science workflow; Jupyter notebooks; Notebooks; Source code classification; Workflow analysis,Article,Scopus

Experimental results over UCI data sets show that the manifold regularized SVDD can effectively detect the noise labels data, and presents better performance over most methods in terms of the outlier detection accuracy, and the average accuracy is mostly above 50%, even 100%.

Methods: The cohort consisted of 98 adult glioblastomas. A standard brain tumor magnetic resonance (MR) imaging protocol, was performed on a 3T MR scanner. Visually Accessible REMBRANDT Images (VASARI) features were assessed. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis followed by a log-rank test and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to investigate the effects of VASARI features along with the age, gender, the extent of resection, pre- and post-KPS, ki67 and P53 mutation status on overall survival. Supervised machine learning algorithms were employed to predict the survival of glioblastoma patients based on 12, 19, and 24 months thresholds. Results: Tumor location (p<0.001), the proportion of non-enhancing component (p=0.0482), and proportion of necrosis (p=0.02) were significantly associated with overall survival based on Kaplan-Meier analysis. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that increases in proportion of non-enhancing component (p=0.040) and proportion of necrosis (p=0.039) were significantly associated with overall survival. Machine-learning models were successful in differentiating patients living longer than 12 months with 96.40% accuracy (sensitivity=97.22%, specificity=95.55%). The classification accuracies based on 19 and 24 months survival thresholds were 70.87% (sensitivity=83.02%, specificity=60.11%) and 74.66% (sensitivity=67.58%, specificity=82.08%), respectively.

Also, the weakness of RAC itself further compound the problem. This paper aspires to deliver an alternative means to address this difficulty. A powerful boosting approach, XGBoost, was developed to fulfill the goal, where its hyperparameters was fine-tuned by a beetle antennae search metaheuristic algorithm. Meanwhile, a synthetic data generator, tabular generative adversarial networks, was introduced to supplement the limited training data. The model developed outperformed existing empirical equations and several baseline machine learning models.

Specifically, we design a Knowledge Enhanced Few-shot Transformer ISCD model (KEFT-ISCD) to enhance reservoir sample features. We design a dynamically balanced marginal softmax (dbm-softmax) to further optimize the model loss for identifying edge features, which improves the stratigraphic matching effects. In addition, we design a bi-window co-sliding approach to address the cross-matching problem in practical stratigraphic matching. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use few-shot learning for the ISCD. We evaluate the proposed method with different well sections in a pair of adjacent wells from a real-world well logging dataset.

Various noise monitoring and simulation techniques have been developed to measure and evaluate urban sounds. However, sensing large areas at a fine resolution remains a great challenge. Based on machine learning, we introduce a new application of street view imagery — estimating large-area high-resolution urban soundscapes, investigating the premise that we can predict and characterize soundscapes without laborious and expensive noise measurements. First, visual features are extracted from street-level imagery using computer vision. Second, fifteen soundscape indicators are identified and a survey is conducted to gauge them solely from images. Finally, a prediction model is constructed to infer the urban soundscape by modeling the non-linear relationship between them. The results are verified with extensive field surveys. Experiments conducted in Singapore and Shenzhen using half a million images affirm that street view imagery enables us to sense large-scale urban soundscapes with low cost but high accuracy and detail, and provides an alternative means to generate soundscape maps. R2 reaches 0.48 by evaluating the predicted results with field data collection. Further novelties in this domain are revealing the contributing visual elements and spatial laws of soundscapes, underscoring the usability of crowdsourced data, and exposing international patterns in perception. © 2022",Built environment; Deep learning; GeoAI; Perception; Spatial analysis; Urban planning,Article,Scopus

The constitutive parameters are typically established by fitting of mechanical data, while microstructural data is used for verification. This paper develops a Pareto-based multi-objective machine learning methodology for efficient identification of crystal plasticity constitutive parameters. Specifically, the methodology relays on a Gaussian processes-based surrogate model to limit the number of calls to a given crystal plasticity model, and, consequently, to increase the computational efficiency. The constitutive parameters pertaining to an Elasto-Plastic Self-Consistent (EPSC) crystal plasticity model including a dislocation density-based hardening law, a backstress law, and a phase transformations law are identified for two materials, a dual phase (DP) steel, DP780, subjected to load reversals and a stainless steel (SS), 316L, subjected to strain rate and temperature sensitive deformation. The latter material undergoes plasticity-induced martensitic phase transformations. The optimization objectives were the quasi static flow stress data for the DP steel case study, while a set of strain-rate and temperature sensitive flow stress and phase volume fraction data for the SS case study. The procedure and results for the two case studies are presented and discussed illustrating advantages and versatility of the developed methodology. In particular, the efficiency of the developed methodology over an existing genetic algorithm methodology is discussed. Additionally, the parameters identified for the SS case study were utilized to simulate three biaxial tensile loading paths using a finite element implementation of EPSC for further verification. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Crystal plasticity; Machine learning; Numerical algorithms; Parameter identification,Article,Scopus

Detection of a kick at early stage leaves more time for the drilling crew to take necessary actions. In this work, a novel intelligent model is proposed for early kick detection, which incorporates feature transformation, cost-sensitive dataset construction, and ensemble learning. It applies 7 wellhead feature parameters as input. The model is trained and tested with the field data of a shale gas reservoir in Sichuan. The model performances under different data dimensions and misclassification costs are evaluated. It is found that when the data dimension is 6 and the misclassification cost is 3, the model has the best classification ability (Total Cost=0.9, Accuracy=0.998, Recall=0.990, Precision=0.986). The low false alarm rate helps to minimize wastage of drilling time. The ablation experiment and the comparison with conventional sampling methods unanimously prove the superiority of the proposed model. Datasets with various sizes and imbalance ratios are tested and the model shows satisfactory accuracy. The formula of the optimal misclassification cost is derived for the instruction of field application.

Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is a gating mechanism in recurrent neural network and is a deep learning model that excels in processing sequential information and can be used to learn potential fault features in the condition monitoring data for FD. However, lack of sufficient fault samples (i.e., few samples) in NPPs prevents the GRU network from being adequately trained, resulting in poor performance. This study proposes a new GRU network combined with attention mechanism (AM) and transfer learning (TL), called GRU-AM-TL method. The attention layer is introduced to adaptively assign different weights to the extracted features for discrepant processing and enhancing focus on valuable information. The TL strategy tries to make full use of diagnosis knowledge learned from relevant fault datasets under different operating conditions, different machines or different fault severity for improving new diagnosis task under few samples. The specific FD target is to identify the fault nature (location, size or severity) by pattern recognition. Bearing, gearbox and NPP simulated fault datasets are used to validate the proposed method. Case study shows that the AM and TL strategy can help GRU network improve diagnosis accuracy under few sample scenarios. Moreover, the proposed GRU-AM-TL method can achieve the best performance in all test cases compared with GRU-based methods and other classical methods, such as convolutional neural network, support vector machine and random forest, showing good FD advantage in NPPs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Attention mechanism; Fault diagnosis; Few samples; Gated recurrent unit network; Nuclear power plant; Transfer learning,Article,Scopus

Deep learning approaches has proven to be highly accurate especially when there is enough data to train the model and high computation powers. People detection and counting is a challenging problem. due to several issues such as occlusion, light variations, complex backgrounds to name a few.

However, their design equations are more complicated than those of steel and reinforced concrete (RC) structures, especially for circular columns under eccentric loading. Therefore, the use of emerging data-driven approaches will help structural engineers ease the design process. This paper explores the use of data-driven design methods as alternatives to conventional mechanics-based design models. Five boosting algorithms, including adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), gradient boosting machine (GBR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and categorical gradient boosting (CatBoost), are employed to develop predictive models for four different types of CFST columns (i.e., circular columns, rectangular columns, circular beam–columns, and rectangular beam–columns). These predictive models are trained using the most up-to-date and comprehensive database collected from over 3,200 test specimens. Reliability analysis is conducted to calibrate the resistance reduction factors for three different design frameworks (i.e., the US, Eurocode, and Australian frameworks) to ensure that the newly developed predictive models meet the target reliability indices required by different design frameworks.

Queries for similar objects lead to the well-known machine learning task of nearest-neighbours identification. Many data indexing strategies, collectively known as Metric Access Methods (MAM), have been proposed to speed up these queries. Moreover, since exact approaches to solving similarity queries can be complex and time-consuming, alternative options have emerged to reduce query execution time, such as returning approximate results or resorting to distributed computing platforms. In this paper, we introduce MASK (Multilevel Approximate Similarity search with k-means), an unconventional application of the k-means algorithm as the foundation of a multilevel index structure for approximate similarity search suitable for metric spaces. We show that this method leverages inherent properties of k-means for this purpose, like representing high-density data areas with fewer prototypes. An implementation of this new indexing procedure is evaluated using a synthetic dataset and two real-world datasets in high-dimensional and high-sparsity spaces. Experimental tests show that MASK performs better than alternative algorithms for approximate similarity search.

Due to the variety of polyurethane modifiers, the preparation process of the polyurethane-modified bitumen is not universally applicable. However, the traditional methods such as the response surface method and orthogonal design method have some problems such as low accuracy and a large number of samples required in the preparation process design. Therefore, according to different application environments, the problem of determining the process parameters of the polyurethane-modified bitumen accurately and efficiently needs to be solved urgently. Using Kriging-Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, an efficient process design method for the preparation of polyurethane modified asphalt is proposed in this paper. Combined with the sensitivity analysis method, the relatively sensitive response indexes are screened out to reduce the number of samples and improve the design accuracy. Among them, the dispersion coefficient was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy test using the Christiansen coefficient method to evaluate the uniformity of the dispersed phase of the polyurethane modifier. According to the target performance, the main process parameters of PU modified asphalt were obtained by the Kriging-Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm: shear time 86 min, shear speed 2450 rpm, shear temperature 148 °C, and polyurethane content 18.6%. The polyurethane-modified bitumen prepared by this optimal process met the expected performance indicators.

However, most of existing works either incorporate a single-scale attention module, or the embedded attentions work independently. Though promising results are achieved, they may fail to mine different subtle visual clues. To mitigate this issue, a novel framework called cascaded attention network (CANet) is proposed, which allows to mine diverse clues and integrate them into final multi-granularity features by a cascaded manner. Specifically, we design a novel hybrid pooling attention module (HPAM) and plug it into backbone network at different stages. To make them work collaboratively, an inter-attention regularization is applied, such that they can localize complementary salient features. Then, CANet extracts global and local features from a part-based pyramidal architecture. For better feature robustness, supervision is applied to not only the pyramidal branches, but also those intermediate attention modules. Furthermore, within each supervision branch, hybrid pooling with two different strides is executed to enhance feature representation capabilities. Extensive experiments with ablation analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and state-of-the-art results are achieved on three public benchmark datasets, including Market-1501, CUHK03, and DukeMTMC-ReID. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Attention; Feature representation; Neural network; Person re-identification; Visual clues,Article,Scopus

However, to date, the pharmacological mechanisms remain vague. Methods: To explore the underlying mechanisms of QZTS in treating DKD using network pharmacology, machine learning, molecular docking and experimental assessment. Results: First, we found that QZTS improved glycolipid metabolism disorder, decreased proteinuria and alleviated kidney tissue injury in DKD model KKAy mice. Then, by integrating multiple databases, a total of 96 targets of 74 active compounds in QZTS and 759 DKD-related genes were acquired. Next, we identified 13 hub targets of QZTS in DKD by three rank algorithms, including functional similarity, topological similarity and shortest path. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses demonstrated that the pathways mainly centered on the processes of glycolipid metabolism disorder, inflammation and angiogenesis. Among them, VEGF signaling pathway was significantly enriched. Molecular docking showed that key active compounds of QZTS all had relatively good binding affinity with predicted hub targets. Finally, animal experiments found that QZTS significantly inhibited the secretion of plasma VEGF and downregulated the protein and mRNA expression levels of AKT, p38MAPK and VEGFR2. Conclusion: Our results indicated that QZTS treated DKD via multiple targets and pathways and the VEGF signaling pathway may be highly involved in this process. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH",Diabetic kidney disease; Machine learning; Network pharmacology; VEGF,Article,Scopus

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) play a vital role in performing many remote applications without human intervention. WSNs are an integral part of an ubiquitous computing and Internet of Everything (IoE). A WSN is a decentralized network comprised of several tiny but powerful sensor nodes. Sensor nodes are restricted in terms of battery life, communication range, bandwidth, processing latency, and memory. Effective usage of WSN resources is a challenging task to enhance network lifespan, increase throughput, reduce computational delay and minimize control overheads. Several intelligent strategies are proposed to improve WSN performance and enhance the lifespan of the network by adopting intelligent resource management schemes. In WSN, effective and intelligent resource management involves resource discovery, resource scheduling, and resource allocation. In this paper, a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) supervised machine learning algorithm is used to deal with incomplete information about the network i.e., uncertainty and dynamicity for effective resource allocation. The scheme operates as follows: The k-means clustering algorithm is applied to the network, clusters are formed, the Cluster Head (CH) is selected, and the k-NN algorithm is applied to find the number of neighbor nodes i.e., Cluster Members (CM) in the cluster. The attributes of CH like distance from base station, degree of connectivity, congestion rate, data type and size aggregated at CH after performing a task and channel quality are calculated. Aggregation and classification of CM and CH attributes (data sets) use intelligent search and feature selection algorithms. The data sets are then processed for the training and prediction phases. A decision tree model is built using target attribute, which is resource (bandwidth) allocation. A heat map and confusion matrix are generated and a performance evaluation of the proposed scheme is done. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed CART based resource allocation approach is better as compared with the “Linear Regression (LR), Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3), and Neural Network (NN)” schemes in terms of resource allocation accuracy, allocation computational delay, data transmission efficiency, etc. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Bandwidth; CART; Resource allocation; WSN,Article,Scopus

To achieve this goal, in DoH protocol, DNS traffic between a DNS client and its local DNS resolver is channeled through an encrypted HTTPS tunnel. However, as shown in previous studies, adversaries can still infer users’ web browsing activities from encrypted DoH traffic through machine-learning-based traffic analysis (TA) attacks. These attacks rely on unencryptable features in the DNS footprint of a website, including query/response lengths and counts and delays between subsequent queries (timing), to identify which website is being visited. To defend against such TA attacks, existing DoH clients and resolvers pad DNS queries and responses with null bytes to specific block sizes before encrypting them, as recommended in RFC 8467. However, as shown by prior research and our current work, this padding alone is not effective in defeating TA attacks, and even with this padding, attackers can still achieve over 95% accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel client-side obfuscation approach to defeat TA attacks on the DoH footprint of websites. Using a combination of (1) compression-aware padding, (2) fake query injection, and (3) random delaying of queries, our approach obfuscates query/response lengths, counts, and timings. Our approach does not require changes to existing protocols and is incrementally deployed on client machines as a local proxy. Using a robust classifier with a comprehensive set of over 150 features derived from recently proposed traffic analysis attacks on encrypted DNS traffic and experimenting with the Cloudflare and Google resolvers and 200 target websites, we show that while with the existing padding-only obfuscation, the TA attacker can achieve over 95.58% accuracy, our obfuscation algorithm can degrade this accuracy to below 9% with reasonable overhead. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Cyber deception; DNS over HTTPS; DNS traffic obfuscation; Traffic analysis attacks; Web fingerprinting,Article,Scopus

Monitoring forest degradation as compared to deforestation presents technical challenges because degradation involves widespread, low-intensity AGB removal under varying temporal dynamics. Charcoal production is a key driver for forest degradation in Africa and is projected to increase in the future years. In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where charcoal production drives widespread ABG removal, the utility of optical remote sensing for degradation quantification is challenged by the large inter-seasonal variation and high complexities in ecosystem structure. Limited field measurements on tree structure and aboveground biomass density (AGBD) in many parts of the SSA also impose constraints. In this study, we present a novel data fusion approach combining 3D forest structure from NASA's GEDI Lidar with optical time-series data from Landsat to quantify biomass losses associated with charcoal-related forest degradation over a 10-year time period. We used machine learning models with Landsat spectral indices from the time period of limited hydric stress (LHS) as predictor variables. By applying the best performing Random Forest (RF) model to LandTrendr-stabilized annual LHS Landsat composites, we produced annual forest AGBD maps from 2007 to 2019 over the Mabalane district in southern Mozambique where the dry forest ecosystem was under active charcoal-related degradation since 2008. The RF model achieved an RMSE value of 7.05 Mg/ha (RMSE% = 42%) and R2 value of 0.64 using a 10-fold cross-validation dataset. We quantified a total AGB loss of 2.12 ± 0.06 Megatons (Mt) over the 10-year period, which is only 6.35 ± 2.56% less than the total loss estimated using field-based data as previously published for the same area and time. In addition to quantifying biomass loss, we constructed annual AGBD maps that enabled the characterization of disturbance and recovery. Our framework demonstrates that fusing GEDI and Landsat data through predictive modeling can be used to quantify past forest AGBD dynamics in low biomass forests. This approach provides a satellite-based method to support REDD+ monitoring and evaluation activities in areas where field data is limited and has the potential to be extended to investigate a variety of different disturbance events. © 2022",Africa; Charcoal; Data fusion; Forest biomass; Forest degradation; Forest recovery; GEDI; Landsat; Miombo,Article,Scopus

A major part of big data preprocessing is feature selection (reduction). There are 2n alternative feature subsets for every n features, making it difficult to choose the best set of features from a dataset using typical feature selection techniques. Consequently, the present study proposes and suggests a unique feature selection method based on the Eagle Strategy(ESO) Optimization, Gravitational Search Optimization (GSO) algorithm, and their hybrid algorithm. We chose this infection as our subject of investigation since the number of women with breast cancer is increasing rapidly on a global scale. After lung cancer, which affects more women than any other kind of cancer, breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality. The goal of this study is to categorize breast cancer into two groups using the benchmark feature set (Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC)) and to choose the fewest features (feature selection) to achieve maximum accuracy. This work also provides a hybrid technique for finding important features that combines two algorithms, ESO and the GSO algorithm, while reducing insignificant characteristics (features) and complexity. Soft computing technologies and machine learning algorithms provide a framework for prognostic research by classifying data instances as relevant or irrelevant depending on cancer severity. Thus, this work presented a new approach for classifying breast cancer tumors. In this research, we coupled soft computing methodologies—our implemented algorithms are applied for the first time to this problem—with artificial intelligence-based machine learning strategies to create a prediction model. The efficacy of our suggested technique was evaluated using WDBC breast cancer data sets, and the findings show that our proposed hybrid algorithm performs very well in breast cancer classification. We have been able to attain astonishing results with accuracy up to 98.9578%, sensitivity up to 0.9705, specificity up to 1.000, precision up to 1.000, F1-score up to 0.9696, and an AUC up to 0.9980 (close to maximum, i.e., 1.0000).

In this scenario, deep-learning and artificial intelligence embody the new frontier of healthcare system, by overcoming the subjectivity of clinicians in the analysis of medical images. However, the preliminary attempts in exploiting the power of machine learning algorithms such as neural networks are still limited to bone macro-scale, while there is an evident lack in their application to smaller scales, where damage starts nucleating. Currently, speculations at the micro-scale are only feasible with the aid of high-resolution imaging techniques, that are particularly time consuming in terms of output images analysis. In this context, this works aims at combining the visualization of the micro-crack propagation mechanism with the promising application of convolutional neural networks. The implemented artificial intelligence tool is based for the first time on a large number of human synchrotron images coming from healthy and osteoporotic femoral heads tested under micro-compression. The designed convolutional neural networks are able to automatically detect lacunae and micro-cracks at different compression levels with high accuracy levels; indeed, with the baseline setup, networks achieve more than 0.99 level of accuracy for both cracks and lacunae, and more than 0.87 of the meanIoU adopted as validation metric.

However, such practice may not yield systems that are robust with respect to a broad array of rainfall conditions. To tackle this problem, we contribute a novel computational framework characterized by two distinguishing features. First, we use multiple rainfall events throughout the design process; and, second, we rely on faster emulators (instead of process-based models) to manage the inevitable increase in the computational requirements. In particular, our framework moves through five steps accounting for the generation of stochastic rainfall events, the selection of decision variables (via sensitivity analysis), emulator identification, emulation-based optimization, and ex-post robustness analysis. To test our framework, we implement it on a 33-km2 basin in Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam) and benchmark it against a more traditional approach based on design storms. Results show that there are untapped opportunities for improving drainage performance without altering investment costs. For example, we found that a budget of $30 million can yield an overflow reduction of about 85% or 50% depending on whether we rely on stochastic rainfall events or design storms. Importantly, such improvements do not affect the computational requirements, owing to the use of emulators. The framework is applicable to other basins and could be readily extended to other sources of uncertainty, such as land use change, or climate change scenarios, which are expected to pose additional strains on urban drainage systems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Green infrastructure; Machine learning; Optimization; Robustness; Stormwater management,Article,Scopus

This work reviewed the previous studies from the perspective of anammox granules lifecycle and proposed various sustainable formation mechanisms of anammox granules. By reviewing the anaerobic, aerobic, and anammox granulation mechanisms, we summarize the mechanisms of thermodynamic theory, heterogeneous growth, extracellular polymeric substance (EPS)-based adhesion, quorum sensing (QS)-based regulation, biomineralization-based growth, and stratification of microorganisms to understand anammox granulation. In the regeneration process, the formation of precursors for re-granulation is explained by the mechanisms of physical crushing, quorum quenching and dispersion cue sensing. Based on the granulation cycle mechanism, the rebuilding of the normal regeneration process is considered essential to avoid granule floatation and the wash-out of granules. This comprehensive review indicates that future research on anammox granulation cycle should focus on the effects of filamentous bacteria in denitrification-anammox granulation cycle, the role of QS/ quorum quenching (QQ)-based autoinducers, development of diversified mechanisms to understand the cycle and the cycle mechanisms of stored granules. © 2022",Anammox granular sludge; EPS; Floatation; Machine learning; Nitrogen removal; Quorum sensing,Review,Scopus

But the development of this kind of technology model that mimics humans involves a lot of complex calculations and complex algorithms that are difficult to explain and understand. For this problem, the concept of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is developed and introduced. It is the technology that is developed to ease the understanding process of machine learning solutions for humans. It is the concept that is being developed for making it convenient for humans to understand and interpret machine language. Black model machine learning (ML) algorithms are very hard to understand for humans who have not developed them. AI models that involve the methods like genetic algorithms or deep learning concepts are very difficult to understand. It sometimes becomes a very hard task for the domain experts too to understand the ML algorithms of the black block models, so the need for the development of this type of technology was felt. Many times, results are developed with very high accuracy are quite easy to understand for the domain experts. But Explainable artificial intelligence has a great potential to make a change in domains like finance, medicines, etc. It plays a vital role where it is important to understand the results to build trustworthy algorithms. XAI can play a great role in “third-wave AI systems” which include machines that can interact directly with the environment and that can build explanatory models that allow them to develop the characteristics of real-world phenomena. XAI has the potential to play a great role where the organizations need to build trustworthy AI models and to make them trustworthy the explainability of the AI models should be there for others as well. This technology is developed primarily to make AI understandable to those who are practitioners. This book chapter presents a wide and insightful view of XAI and its application in various fields. This chapter also includes the future scope of this technology and the need for the growth of this type of technology. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Explainable artificial intelligence; Explainable methods; Machine learning,Book Chapter,Scopus

Machine Learning is also a part of AI and is used in various fields of decision-making by using different algorithms. In the last few decades, AI has gained more popularity in the field of Industry, Medicine, Education, Defense, etc. Based on the algorithm AI is categorized into: Interpretable AI and Explainable AI (XAI). In interpretable AI, experts have problems in understanding the working of the model. They have no idea of working behind the algorithm so from here the term explainable AI came into existence. The term Explainable AI is coined by DARPA. This is also known as Explainable Machine Learning. The term came into existence to provide transparency in the process of decision-making by different Machine learning algorithms. In the current scenario, XAI is gaining popularity because of its transparent working. XAI is used in every field where AI can be used but with some modification or by adding some techniques of XAI as “SHAP (Shaply Additive exPlanations), DeepSHAP, DeepLIFT, CXplain, and LIME”. The main goal of this chapter is to provide a brief overview of XAI by covering almost every aspect of XAI. The chapter is divided into sections, in the first section brief introduction is discussed. Related work concerning medicine is stated in Sect. 2. Later other sections will cover principles, techniques, current state of art, benefits, and, applications. This chapter infers that XAI is a great development in AI due to its transparent nature.

The availability of enormous datasets, as well as recent advancements in deep learning methods, are allowing AI systems to perform at or even beyond the level of human performance on an expanding variety of challenging tasks. However, because of their layered non-linear structure, these strong models have traditionally been regarded as “black boxes,” since they provide no information about how they arrive at their predictions and hence cannot be used trustily to generate predictions. They are often opaque, but they are capable of making accurate predictions that cannot be explained in any other way. All of these choices are having an increasing amount of effect on the lives of individuals. The distrust of totally non-human, autonomous artificial intelligence systems is established as the cornerstone of the movement. The root of distrust lies in a lack of knowledge as to why intelligent systems make certain decisions in certain situations. As a result, this problem has sparked a fresh discussion over explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Several lines of research work have since picked up on the definition, understanding, and implementation of explainability, including expert systems, machine learning, recommender systems, and approaches to neural-symbolic learning and reasoning, all of which have occurred primarily during different periods in the history of artificial intelligence. This chapter serves as an introduction for academics and practitioners who are interested in learning about essential parts of the new and quickly increasing field of research on XAI. The first section, titled “Introduction,” provides an overall summary of the Explainable Artificial Intelligence. Section 2 describes the need of trust and transparency in AI, which is what led to the development of the idea of XAI.

This compact, flexible regression model can work well with the data that takes the form of high-dimensional arrays, also known as tensors, with just a smaller number of parameters than traditional vector-based regression models. In addition, we have replaced the canonical dimension tree in the original HTR with the front-to-back splitting dimension tree, which leads to the front-to-back splitting Hierarchical Tucker Regression. This tree structure is a special case of Hierarchical Tucker format that can present Tensor-Train Decomposition (TTD), which provides a condition in determining the general rank bounds for the Hierarchical Tucker rank of HTD based on the rank of the TTD. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on both simulated and real data. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Classification; Front-to-back hierarchical tucker regression; Hierarchical tucker decomposition; Regression,Conference Paper,Scopus

In this chapter attention will be focused on those particular kinds of abductive cognition that generate deep results, able to go beyond data thanks to a rich explanatory strength, in which asking “why” is the key-factor. Hypothetical cognition beyond data will be also described thanks to the illustration of model-based aspects of abduction, in which the activity of grasping the world, beyond what mere rough data suggests, takes advantage of models, diagrams, and simulations of various nature. Moreover, I will delineate the concept of manipulative abduction, first introduced in my book of Abduction, Reason, and Science, by showing how we can find methods of manipulative constructivity, in which cognitive processes are centered on the exploitation of external representations to the aim of reaching deep and very abstract results, able to powerfully transcend data, at the same time to create cognitive values “in” and “out” of data. In two separated sections I will illustrate (1) how the excessive emphasis on the merits of the computational programs which learn from data renders human abductive “creative” cognition increasingly assaulted and jeopardized, and (2) the challenges against human abduction and epistemic rigor on the part of what I call computational invasive “subcultures” based on rough computational explanations. Finally, thanks to the analysis of the computational system called AlphaGo, I will stress the attention to what I call locked and unlocked strategies that shed further light on the cognitive aspects of both humans and deep learning machines. The character and the role of these cognitive strategies is strictly related to the generation of cognitive outputs, which range from weak (closer to data) to strong level (beyond data) of knowledge creativity. Locked abductive strategies, even if cognitively weak, characterize (sometimes amazing) kinds of hypothetical creative reasoning and are typical of intelligent machines based on a massive exploitation of data, but they are limited in eco-cognitive openness, which instead qualifies human cognizers who are performing higher kinds of abductive creative reasoning, where cognitive strategies are instead unlocked and are able to transcend data. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Abductive cognition; AlphaGo; AlphaZero; Creativity; Data; Deep learning; Locked and unlocked strategies,Book Chapter,Scopus

The VA uses information about the schema of the data source to guide the user. The query is built incrementally. To test the proposed method, we implemented a dialogue system for querying a part of the Open Food Facts database. The evaluation results show that users successfully completed the task in most cases. The easiest task was completed by 72% of users, the most sophisticated task was completed by 58% of users.

This humungous amount of data is nowadays available in nearly every field, be it science or social domain. As much of these collected data are time-sensitive, they need to be utilized timely to give an effective outcome. Data fusion is of paramount significance in enhancing the collected data's effectiveness. But, today, as AI has gained significant momentum, machine learning (ML) techniques, mainly deep neural network (DNN), are widely utilized to deliver what is expected from the data. Edge intelligence tries to fulfil the promise of giving efficient and timely output. Deep learning, undoubtedly being robust, also possesses some disadvantages, and one of these relates to the explainability of ML methods that help solve any problem. With dense layers in DNN and millions of parameters, it is difficult to interpret the model creating a black box. The chapter aims to outline the explainability of data fusion at the edge. It highlights different data models of fusion, discusses a framework for AI and data fusion at the edge and identifies potential challenges and possible solutions in this regard. While doing so, the chapter intends to cover the fundamentals of explainability in AI, the need to convert the black box system into a transparent one, and the associated opportunities for explainable artificial intelligence. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Data fusion; Edge computing; Explainable AI; Intelligent machine learning; XAI,Book Chapter,Scopus

Recently, computer vision algorithms have enhanced the RE process and strengthen its capabilities to reconstruct challenging shapes. Nevertheless, the large body of the reported literature is restricted to estimate the 3D shape of the scanned part from a single/multiple 2D/3D image based on predefined classes using supervised learning.

While current research to fight the underlying causes of PD are underway, diagnosis remains a pertinent issue due to an absence of formal lab based tests. Patients with PD often develop abnormal speech patterns, such as the slurring of words. This study aims to utilize and compare various different Gradient Boosting models to diagnose PD based on audio data taken from a patient. Additionally, this study also tests these models with mRMR feature selection, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction, Min-Max normalization, and standardization. The dataset used in this study was the UCI Machine Learning Repository’s Parkinsons Data Set. The dataset includes 195 voice recordings from 31 subjects with 22 biomedical voice measurements per recording. 48 of the voice recordings in the dataset were from patients without PD and 147 of the voice recordings were from patients with PD. 60% of the voice recordings were used for model training, 20% for cross validation, and 20% for the test set. The HistGradientBoosting model with Min-Max normalization and mRMR feature selection was found to perform the best on the cross validation set, in which it had an accuracy of 94.8718%, a sensitivity of 96.7742%, a specificity of 87.5000%, an AUC score of 0.921371, and an F1 score of 0.967742.

From 2012 to 2017, the incidence of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) rose from 7.3 cases per 100,000 to 19.3 per 100,000. Anatomical TSA saw a growth from 9.5 cases per 100,000 to 12.5 per 100,000. Failure to identify implants in a timely manner can increase operative time, cost and risk of complications. Several machine learning models have been developed to perform medical image analysis. However, they have not been widely applied in shoulder surgery. The authors developed a machine learning model to identify shoulder implant manufacturers and type from anterior-posterior X-ray images. Methods: The model deployed was a convolutional neural network (CNN), which has been widely used in computer vision tasks. 696 radiographs were obtained from a single institution. 70% were used to train the model, while evaluation was done on 30%. Results: On the evaluation set, the model performed with an overall accuracy of 93.9% with positive predictive value, sensitivity and F-1 scores of 94% across 10 different implant types (4 reverse, 6 anatomical). Average identification time was 0.110 s per implant. Conclusion: This proof of concept study demonstrates that machine learning can assist with preoperative planning and improve cost-efficiency in shoulder surgery. © 2022 Professor P K Surendran Memorial Education Foundation",Digital medicine; Implant identification; Machine learning; Mobile application; Total shoulder arthroplasty,Article,Scopus

The expression of CBX genes was significantly changed in four cancer types, i.e., cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). The fold change (FC) values suggest that CBX2 was significantly upregulated in CHOL (FC = 1.639), COAD (FC = 1.734), and LUSC (FC = 1.506). On the other hand, CBX7 was found downregulated in COAD (FC = ?1.209), LUAD (FC = ?1.190), and LUSC (FC = ?1.214). The performance of machine learning models for classification was excellent.

However, those proposed models have difficulty interpreting and understanding why an individual has suicidal attempts. To overcome this issue, the identification of features such as risk factors in predicting suicide attempts is important for clinicians to make decisions. Therefore, the aim of this study is to propose an explainable predictive model to predict and analyse the importance of features for suicide attempts. This model can also provide explanations to improve the clinical understanding of suicide attempts. Two complex ensemble learning models, namely Random Forest and Gradient Boosting with an explanatory model (SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)) have been constructed. The models are used for predictive interpretation and understanding of the importance of the features. The experiment shows that both models with SHAP are able to interpret and understand the nature of an individual's predictions with suicide attempts. However, compared with Random Forest, the results show that Gradient Boosting with SHAP achieves higher accuracy and the analyses found that history of suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, and ethnicity as the main predictors for suicide attempts. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Ensemble learning; Explainable AI; Predictive model; SHAP; Suicide attempt risk,Article,Scopus

To inform policies that effectively promote this shift, we distinguish between prevention actions aimed at more fire-resilient landscapes and those focused on the protection of people, i.e., wildfire mitigation and adaptation (WM&A), respectively. With the goal of discussing the usefulness of this distinction and identifying local factors and external resources that promote each of those preventive actions, we developed an analysis of collective WM&A actions across 116 parishes in a wildfire-prone region in Portugal, using primary and secondary data. Two principal component analyses were used to explore relationships between variables expressing collective WM&A actions. Random forest, a machine learning technique based on multiple decision trees, was used to model how those actions are related to local factors (land use/land cover, population, institutions) and access to policy funding for wildfire prevention. Our results showed that collective mitigation and adaptation responses to wildfire are locally independent, in coherence with their distinct goals, actors involved, and institutional and policy framing. Mitigation through owners’ collaboration proved to be strongly related to policy funding (notably that exclusively addressed at mitigation), local socioeconomic dynamism, and ownership structure, whereas adaptation responses are related with leadership by local governments. Considering these differences, the incipiency of adaptation actions, and the difficulties in expanding owner's collaboratives beyond the most favourable local conditions, we conclude that mitigation and adaptation actions are currently supported by two distinct policy domains with unequal consolidation but equally underfunded. © 2022 The Authors",Collective action; Governance regimes; Local governments; Owner collaboratives; Wildfire policies; Wildfire responses,Article,Scopus

The oxidative weathering of metal sulfides leads to AMD. The acidic environment corrodes more harmful compounds in the soil, which is spread throughout the working area. One such significant metal is copper, which is extracted in massive quantities from ores rich in sulfide. A copper-extraction resin might be created by combining diatomaceous earth (DE) particles with polyethyleneimine (PEI), which is shown to have great selectivity and affinity for copper. In this effort, PEI-DE particles’ copper absorption level was examined by using synthetic and actual acid mine drainage samples at varied pH values. The findings of the copper uptake particles have been examined through the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. Using the n-fold 14 cross-validation approach, the quantities of parameters and C are estimated to be 0.001 and 0.01, respectively. The SVM analysis was correct, and the findings indicated that copper could bind to the material efficiently and preferentially at pH 4. Subsequent water elution studies at a pH value of 1 confirmed the pH-reliant interaction between dissolved Cu and PEI by demonstrating full release of the adsorbed Cu. In this research, the copper absorption of PEI-DE particles from synthetic and genuine AMD specimens was studied based on several pH conditions. The findings suggest that copper may attach to the material effectively and preferentially at pH 4. Studies of filtering water at pH1 later confirmed that all of the adsorbed Cu was released. This shows that the interaction between PEI and dissolved Cu depends on PH. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Acid mine drainage (AND); Artificial intelligence; Coal mines; Copper; Diatomaceous earth (DE); Polyethyleneimine particles (PEI); Support vector machine (SVM); Water,Article,Scopus

Since we as a community don't understand the exact physical relationship between the MBI and seismic properties from well logs, we have used traditional approaches like the log-based brittleness index (LBI) and the elastic brittleness index (EBI) to quantify the rock brittleness from seismic data and well logs. The LBI method is easy to use but is empirically derived from the porosity and sonic logs. On the other hand, the EBI method is dependent on the average values of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio but is not physically meaningful in practice. Therefore, we develop a deep learning approach to obtain a more reliable MBI model from seismic properties and enhance the interpretability with Shapley values. First, we analyze the statistical relationship between the MBI and eight seismic properties from well logs and distinguish the influential input variables for the MBI prediction, such as bulk density, Young's modulus, and Poisson's ratio. Second, we find a multivariate linear regression (MLR) model with three input properties and quantify the relative statistical contribution of each input based on Shapley values. Third, we use a deep neural network technique to derive the nonlinear estimation model with a better fit to the MBI data than the traditional methods. We test and verify our approach on field log and core data from the Wolfcamp shales in the Permian Basin, Texas. In conclusion, this workflow can provide a more interpretable and accurate MBI estimation from seismic properties to enhance unconventional shale reservoir characterization. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Brittleness; Fracturing; Machine learning; Shale; Shapley value; Wolfcamp formation,Article,Scopus

The inputs of the models, in case of power saving, were recovery ratio and system pressure; while system pressure was the input of the models in case of permeate flow. AHA was employed to optimize the performance of pure LSTM via determining the optimal values of the model parameters. A considerable enhancement in prediction accuracy of the optimized model was observed compared with pure model. The coefficient of determination during testing phase of power saving prediction was 0.997 and 0.981 for LSTM-AHA and LSTM, respectively. While it was 0.992 and 0.97 for LSTM-AHA and LSTM, respectively, in case of permeate flow prediction. Furthermore, the saving in consumed power of the RO unit was declined with increasing the recovery ratio.

We collected daily PM2.5 samples (n = ?1000) and analyzed 28 metals every three days from 2016 to 2018 in the northern, central-south, eastern, and southern areas of Taiwan. We first used a machine learning technique with a cluster algorithm coupled with a backward trajectory to classify local, regional, and LRT-related aerosols.

The northern and eastern regions were found to be more vulnerable to LRT-related PM2.5 and metals than the central-south and southern regions in Taiwan. The LRT increased Pb and As concentrations by 90–200% and ?40% in the northern and central-south regions. Ambient PM2.5-metals mainly originated from local traffic-related emissions in the northern, central-south, and southern regions, whereas oil combustion was the primary source of PM2.5-metals in the eastern region.

Real-time thermal comfort assessment is both important in the occupants’ thermal comfort optimization and energy conservation in the building sector. Existing thermal comfort studies mainly focus on the real-time assessment of the occupant's current thermal comfort. Nonetheless, in the transient thermal environment, the occupant's current thermal comfort is not steady and changes moment by moment. Hence, a prediction error will be elicited if we merely assess the occupant's current thermal comfort. To address this problem, it is crucial to comprehend the occupant's real-time thermal sensation trend in the transient thermal environment. A novel thermal sensation index that directly accounts for an occupant's current thermal sensation trend is investigated in this study. By integrating the novel thermal sensation index into an ordinary thermal comfort model, a novel composite thermal comfort model is derived, which can simultaneously address the occupant's current thermal comfort and current thermal sensation trend. Next, by utilizing machine learning classifications, we propose the intrusive and non-intrusive assessment methods of the composite thermal comfort model by analysis of the skin/clothing temperatures of ten local body parts measured by thermocouple thermometers and upper body thermal images measured by a low-cost portable infrared camera. The intrusive method reached a mean accuracy of 59.7% and 52.0% in Scenarios I and II, respectively; the non-intrusive method reached a mean accuracy of 45.3% and 42.7% in Scenarios I and II, respectively.

The total urinary arsenic concentration (mean; 161 ?g/L) of studied participants was lower and/or comparable than those values reported from other highly contaminated regions, but exceeded the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) limits. For all the participants, the most excreted species was DMA accounting for 65% of the total arsenic, followed by MMA (20%) and iAs (16%). The percentage of MMA detected in this study was higher than those of previously reported data from other countries. These results suggested that studied population might have high risk of developing arsenic exposure related adverse health outcomes. Furthermore, random forest machine learning algorithm, partial correlation and binary logistic regression analysis were performed to screen the arsenic species-related urinary metabolites. A total of thirty-eight metabolites were extracted from 2776 metabolic features and identified as the potential arsenic toxicity biomarkers. The metabolites were mainly classified into xanthines, purines, and amino acids, which provided the clues linking the arsenic exposure with oxidative stress, one-carbon metabolism, purine metabolism, caffeine metabolism and hormone metabolism.

The performance of the IRMAC is studied and compared with various state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method reached an accuracy of 96% in identifying rooftop PV users and 94.4% in identifying electric heating users, which is comparable to the best solution based on deep learning, while the speed of the inference model is a thousand times faster. Last but not least, the proposed method is a transparent algorithm, which can tackle the concerns regarding the agnostic decision-making process when policies prohibit some machine learning methods. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Binary classification; Data analytic; Motif discovery; Pattern recognition; Renewable energy; Time series data mining,Article,Scopus

In situations in which the machine is expected to support the decision of human experts, providing a comprehensible explanation is a feature of crucial importance. The language used to communicate the explanations must be formal enough to be implementable in a machine and friendly enough to be understandable by a wide audience. In this paper, we propose a general approach to Explainable Artificial Intelligence in the case of neural architectures, showing how a mindful design of the networks leads to a family of interpretable deep learning models called Logic Explained Networks (LENs). LENs only require their inputs to be human-understandable predicates, and they provide explanations in terms of simple First-Order Logic (FOL) formulas involving such predicates. LENs are general enough to cover a large number of scenarios. Amongst them, we consider the case in which LENs are directly used as special classifiers with the capability of being explainable, or when they act as additional networks with the role of creating the conditions for making a black-box classifier explainable by FOL formulas. Despite supervised learning problems are mostly emphasized, we also show that LENs can learn and provide explanations in unsupervised learning settings. Experimental results on several datasets and tasks show that LENs may yield better classifications than established white-box models, such as decision trees and Bayesian rule lists, while providing more compact and meaningful explanations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Explainable AI; Logic Explained Networks; Neural networks,Article,Scopus

A systematic review published in 2016 analyzed empirical studies on EEE techniques published between 2010 and (January) 2016. The research on EEE has continuously evolved over the past five years (2016–2020), generating new findings that should be aggregated to the existing body of evidence on the subject. The goal of this paper is to update the systematic review from 2016 with new findings from studies published between 2016 (full year) and 2020 (inclusive). To conduct our review update, we followed existing guidelines for updating systematic reviews in software engineering and other fields. We started with an appraisal of the background and methods of the 2016 review, which resulted in the updated review protocol used to conduct our study. We retrieved 3,682 papers using automatic searching techniques, from which we selected 30 papers for data extraction and analysis. Our findings reinforce the results of the previous review in that machine learning is still the technique most common to construct EEE and that the ensemble techniques have outperformed the individual models. We added new evidence showing that there is no clear superiority of an EEE model over the others. Also, we found that ensemble dynamic selection is still little used in Software Effort Estimation (SEE). This review adds new evidence about the use of EEE techniques in software development which reinforces previous findings and also shows research opportunities in constructing more effective EEE. Besides, ensemble dynamic selection appears as a promising area of research which still is underexplored. © 2022","Machine learning; Software effort estimation; Software Engineering; Systematic literature review, Ensemble Effort Estimation",Article,Scopus

Machine learning algorithms provide an effective way to predict geological conditions and have been successful in hard-rock tunnel boring machine (hard-rock TBM) tunnels or earth pressure balance shield machine (EPBM) tunnels. However, the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting geological conditions for super-large diameter SPBM tunnels is still unknown. This study systematically demonstrated the application of machine learning algorithms to the prediction of geological conditions in super-large diameter SPBM tunnels based on field data from the Heyan Road crossing river tunnel. The relationship between SPBM parameters and geological conditions was first evaluated, and subsequently, an adaptive model was proposed to determine the number of input variables. The performance of three algorithms, random forest (RF), AdaBoost, and support vector machine (SVM), in rock mass classification, and seven algorithms, multi-objective random forest (MORF), single-target-RF, regressor chain-RF, single-target-AdaBoost, regressor chain-AdaBoost, single-target-SVM, and regressor chain-SVM, in formation percentage prediction, were compared. The results showed that machine learning algorithms can effectively predict the geological conditions in super-large diameter SPBM tunnels. Specifically, RF had the best performance in rock classification compared with AdaBoost and SVM. MORF outperforms the other six algorithms in terms of formation percentage prediction. Additionally, sensitivity analysis indicates that the newly proposed parameters, including slurry system parameters and cutter type, have a clear positive effect on the performance of geological condition prediction. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Geological condition; Machine learning; Prediction model; Slurry pressure balanced shield machine; Super-large diameter tunnel,Article,Scopus

Most conventional prediction models for time series datasets are time-consuming and fraught with complex limitations because they usually fail to adequately exploit the latent spatial dependence between pairs of variables. As a successful variant of recurrent neural networks, the long short-term memory network (LSTM) has been demonstrated to have stronger nonlinear dynamics to store sequential data than traditional machine learning models. Nevertheless, the common shallow LSTM architecture has limited capacity to fully extract the transient characteristics of long interval sequential datasets. In this study, a novel deep autoregression feature augmented bidirectional LSTM network (DAFA-BiLSTM) is proposed as a new deep BiLSTM architecture for time series prediction. Initially, the input vectors are fed into a vector autoregression (VA) transformation module to represent the time-delayed linear and nonlinear properties of the input signals in an unsupervised way. Then, the learned nonlinear combination vectors of VA are progressively fed into different layers of BiLSTM and the output of the previous BiLSTM module is also concatenated with the time-delayed linear vectors of the VA as an augmented feature to form new additional input signals for the next adjacent BiLSTM layer. Extensive real-world time series applications are addressed to demonstrate the superiority and robustness of the proposed DAFA-BiLSTM. Comparative experimental results and statistical analysis show that the proposed DAFA-BiLSTM has good adaptive performance as well as robustness even in noisy environment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Deep recurrent neural network; Feature augmented; Long short-term memory; Time series prediction; Vector autoregression transformation,Article,Scopus

Such SCADA systems are known to communicate using various insecure protocols such as Modbus, DNP3, and Open Platform Communication (OPC) Data Access standards (providing access to real-time automation data), which are vulnerable to a range of attacks. This leads to increased cyber risks faced in critical infrastructures, especially in the Oil and Gas sector. One of the most popular and critical attacks deployed against such infrastructure is Denial of Service (DoS), as it can have severe consequences that range from financial loss to loss of life. Such attacks can disrupt the ability of an operator to control hazardous operations leading to potentially unsafe scenarios. A novel Field Flooding attack is described which takes advantage of the packet memory structure of the Modbus protocol to perform a DoS attack. This attack can cause overflowing of the memory bank allocated in the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) for Modbus operations. The attack is deployed and evaluated on a real industrial testbed and its impact against the Mitre ATT&CK framework is assessed, in order to identify which tactics an adversary could use to compromise the system. A novel mechanism that utilises supervised machine learning to detect this attack in industrial control system networks is also described.

Objective: We aim at addressing the site availability issue on a hierarchical network by designing an immutable/transparent/source-verifiable quorum mechanism. Methods: We developed an approach to combine a hierarchical learning algorithm, a novel Proof-of-Quorum (PoQ) consensus protocol, and a design of blockchain smart contracts. We constructed QuorumChain as an example and evaluated the scenarios of site-unavailability during the initialization and/or iteration phases of the modeling process on three healthcare/genomic datasets. Results: When one or more sites would become unavailable, HierarchicalChain could not function, whereas QuorumChain improved predictive correctness significantly (the full Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve, or AUC, improved from 0.068 to 0.441, all with p-values < 0.001). Conclusion: By constructing a quorum to continue the modeling process, QuorumChain possesses the capability to tackle the situation of sites being unavailable.

As a potential alternative, we use machine learning and present a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to predict the small-strain response of arbitrarily curved shells. To this end, the shell midsurface is described by a chart, from which the mechanical fields are derived in a curvilinear coordinate frame by adopting Naghdi's shell theory. Unlike in typical PINN applications, the corresponding strong or weak form must therefore be solved in a non-Euclidean domain. We investigate the performance of the proposed PINN in three distinct scenarios, including the well-known Scordelis–Lo roof setting widely used to test FEM shell elements against locking. Results show that the PINN can accurately identify the solution field in all three benchmarks if the equations are presented in their weak form, while it may fail to do so when using the strong form. In the small-thickness limit, where classical methods are susceptible to locking, training time notably increases as the differences in scaling of the membrane, shear, and bending energies lead to adverse numerical stiffness in the gradient flow dynamics. Nevertheless, the PINN can accurately match the ground truth and performs well in the Scordelis–Lo roof benchmark, highlighting its potential for a drastically simplified alternative to designing locking-free shell FEM formulations. © 2022 The Author(s)",Finite Element Method; Machine learning; Shell theory; Structural mechanics,Article,Scopus

One of the main challenges that should be hurdled in their design is modeling the fuel–air mixing process to provide optimal fuel distribution and yield the best engine performance. Injecting fuel into high-speed air stream along multiple parallel struts can augment the fuel penetration and improve mixing efficiency. Mixing intensity is increased with turbulence by the shock-expansion waves in post-strut regions. However, this enhancement in mixing can bring about detrimental effects on the aerodynamic performance by increasing losses on total pressure. Designing the optimal working configuration requires testing the interaction between many design variables. This can be a tedious and computationally costly task. Machine learning models thus appear well-suited for multi-objective optimization of design variables that can be elusive to designers. In particular, non-linear regression models can be built over the available sparse simulation data to predict unseen mixing conditions. In the present work, we carry out a detailed investigation of the effect of multi-strut configuration parameters on three objective functions: mixing efficiency, mixing length, and the total pressure recovery (TPR) factor. These objective functions are linked with the most relevant physical phenomena in the supersonic fuel–air mixing flow field. We first generate a CFD database by solving compressible, non-reactive, Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) filtered flow equations in a 2D scramjet engine domain with three varying design variables: struts location, strut wedge angle and strut V-settlement angle. We then apply various regression models – artificial neural network (ANN), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and kernel regression – to this database and formulate a surrogate model relevant for fuel injection that can be utilized in reduced-order modeling studies that estimate the hypersonic engine performance. We find that regression is generally more difficult in the vicinity of fuel struts (due to turbulence/shock effects) and easier further downstream from the struts, but ANN performs generally better than other regression models. Thus, our reduced-order tool incorporates a mixing efficiency model predicted by the ANN. It computes the thrust of a hypersonic engine with less than 10% error. We also present a detailed discussion of the physical insights gained from our CFD database; we link this discussion with the earlier findings from the machine learning tools. In our sensitivity study, we find the strut wedge angle to be the most influencing parameter on the mixing properties and aerodynamic losses. © 2022 IAA",Hydrogen fuel; Hypersonic propulsion system; Machine learning; Mixing efficiency; Surrogate modeling for fuel injection,Article,Scopus

Such problems present a challenging task for data-driven modeling, with many naive machine learning methods failing to predict or accurately quantify such events. One cause for this difficulty is that systems with extreme events, by definition, yield imbalanced datasets and that standard loss functions easily ignore rare events. That is, metrics for goodness of fit used to train models are not designed to ensure accuracy on rare events. This work seeks to improve the performance of regression models for extreme events by considering loss functions designed to highlight outliers. We propose a novel loss function, the adjusted output weighted loss, and extend the applicability of relative entropy based loss functions to systems with low dimensional output.

Edge computing and autonomous vehicular driving applications are more enhanced under the 6G services that are provided to successfully operate tasks. The huge volume of data resulting from such applications can be a plus in the AI and Machine Learning (ML) world. Traditional ML models are used to train their models on centralized data sets. Lately, data privacy becomes a real aspect to take into consideration while collecting data. For that, Federated Learning (FL) plays nowadays a great role in addressing privacy and technology together by maintaining the ability to learn over decentralized data sets. The training is limited to the user devices only while sharing the locally computed parameter with the server that aggregates those updated weights to optimize a global model. This scenario is repeated multiple rounds for better results and convergence. Most of the literature proposed client selection methods to converge faster and increase accuracy. However, none of them has targeted the ability to deploy and select clients in real-time wherever and whenever needed. In fact, some mobile and vehicular devices are not available to serve as clients in the FL due to the highly dynamic environments and/or do not have the capabilities to accomplish this task. In this paper, we address the aforementioned limitations by introducing an on-demand client deployment in FL offering more volume and heterogeneity of data in the learning process. We make use of containerization technology such as Docker to build efficient environments using any type of client devices serving as volunteering devices, and Kubernetes utility called Kubeadm to monitor the devices. The performed experiments illustrate the relevance of the proposed approach and the efficiency of the deployment of clients whenever and wherever needed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",6G; Artificial Intelligence; Edge computing; Federated Learning; On-demand client deployment; Privacy,Article,Scopus

Our objectives were to: 1) quantify multiannual temporal trends of Na and SAR; 2) construct a regression model to define the relative contribution of various factors on Na and SAR levels in the soil; and 3) determine Na and SAR accumulation impact on the grapevines’ health state (healthy, damaged, or dead). Our analyses indicated that long-term irrigation with TWW resulted in Na accumulation in the soil, with enhanced effects attributed to higher rainfall levels (precipitation levels). Applying TWW for irrigation was also found to affect vines as evident with observations of damaged and dead vines after 9 years, ranging between 25% and 40% mortality rates depending on the treatment used. These observations were found to be directly and significantly associated with higher Na concentrations (p-values of 0.008 and 0.011 compared to damaged and healthy vines, respectively).

Such structures result in high material usage efficiency as bending and buckling issues are absent. Their design begins with finding an initial equilibrium state of the structure, under given stress levels and boundary conditions, called ‘form-finding’. Although several form-finding algorithms are present in the literature, many of these conventional approaches are highly sensitive to the choice of parameters of the chosen method. Other problems, especially that of a proper selection of initial shape and non-convergence in case of large number of degrees of freedom, are also major issues in implementation. This article explores the applicability of a recently developed machine learning algorithm, known as the ‘physics-informed neural network’ (PINN), for the purpose of form-finding. The PINN is used to solve the Euler–Lagrange Equation of minimal surfaces which corresponds to a stable minimal shape of the TMS constrained by the prescribed boundary conditions and constant prestress. The accuracy of the proposed mesh-free method is illustrated using several form-finding case studies for frame-supported TMS. It is observed that the aforementioned issues faced by conventional approaches are efficiently avoided in the proposed framework.

When using metaheuristics to pick features, it is common for the selection of features to vary across runs, which can lead to instability. Because of this, we used the adaptive squirrel search to balance exploration and exploitation duties more evenly in the optimization process.

An ensemble of classifiers can improve the performance of single machine learning (ML) classifiers, especially stacking-based ensemble learning. Stacking utilizes heterogeneous-base learners trained in parallel and combines their predictions using a meta-model to determine the final prediction results. However, building an ensemble often causes the model performance to decrease due to the increasing number of learners that are not being properly selected. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to develop and evaluate a generic, data-independent predictive method using stacked-based ensemble learning (GA-Stacking) optimized by a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for outbreak prediction and health decision aided processes. GA-Stacking utilizes five well-known classifiers, including Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), RIGID regression, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), at its first level. It also introduces GA to identify comparisons to forecast the number, combination, and trust of these base classifiers based on the Mean Squared Error (MSE) as a fitness function. At the second level of the stacked ensemble model, a Linear Regression (LR) classifier is used to produce the final prediction. The performance of the model was evaluated using a publicly available dataset from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, which consisted of 10,722 data samples. The experimental results indicated that the GA-Stacking model achieved outstanding performance with an overall accuracy of 99.99% for the three selected countries. Furthermore, the proposed model achieved good performance when compared with existing bagging-based approaches. The proposed model can be used to predict the pandemic outbreak correctly and may be applied as a generic data-independent model to predict the epidemic trend for other countries when comparing preventive and control measures. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

A person’s face and emotions are deep-faked in a video or speech and are substituted with a different face or voice employing deep learning to analyze speech or emotional content. Because of how clever these videos are frequently, Manipulation is challenging to spot. Social media are the most frequent and dangerous targets since they are weak outlets that are open to extortion or slander a human. In earlier times, it was not so easy to alter the videos, which required expertise in the domain and time. Nowadays, the generation of fake videos has become easier and with a high level of realism in the video. Deepfakes are forgeries and altered visual data that appear in still photos or video footage. Numerous automatic identification systems have been developed to solve this issue, however they are constrained to certain datasets and perform poorly when applied to different datasets. This study aims to develop an ensemble learning model utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) to handle deepfakes or Face2Face. We employed ensemble learning, a technique combining many classifiers to achieve higher prediction performance than a single classifier, boosting the model’s accuracy. The performance of the generated model is evaluated on Face Forensics. This work is about building a new powerful model for automatically identifying deep fake videos with the DeepFake-Detection-Challenges (DFDC) dataset.

Each feature in a dataset has 2n possible subsets, making it challenging to select the optimum collection of features using typical methods. As a result, a new metaheuristics-based feature selection method based on the dipper-throated and grey-wolf optimization (DTO-GW) algorithms has been developed in this research. Instability can result when the selection of features is subject to metaheuristics, which can lead to a wide range of results. Thus, we adopted hybrid optimization in our method of optimizing, which allowed us to better balance exploration and harvesting chores more equitably. We propose utilizing the binary DTO-GW search approach we previously devised for selecting the optimal subset of attributes. In the proposed method, the number of features selected is minimized, while classification accuracy is increased. To test the proposed method’s performance against eleven other state-of-the-art approaches, eight datasets from the UCI repository were used, such as binary grey wolf search (bGWO), binary hybrid grey wolf, and particle swarm optimization (bGWO-PSO), bPSO, binary stochastic fractal search (bSFS), binary whale optimization algorithm (bWOA), binary modified grey wolf optimization (bMGWO), binary multiverse optimization (bMVO), binary bowerbird optimization (bSBO), binary hysteresis optimization (bHy), and binary hysteresis optimization (bHWO).

But the privacy and security become the main hindrances in its achievement due to distributed and open architecture that is prone to intruders. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) refers to one of the commonly utilized system for detecting attacks on cloud. IDS proves to be an effective and promising technique, that identifies malicious activities and known threats by observing traffic data in computers, and warnings are given when such threats were identified. The current mainstream IDS are assisted with machine learning (ML) but have issues of low detection rates and demanded wide feature engineering. This article devises an Enhanced Coyote Optimization with Deep Learning based Intrusion Detection System for Cloud Security (ECODL-IDSCS) model. The ECODL-IDSCS model initially addresses the class imbalance data problem by the use of Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN) technique. For detecting and classification of intrusions, long short term memory (LSTM) model is exploited. In addition, ECO algorithm is derived to optimally fine tune the hyperparameters related to the LSTM model to enhance its detection efficiency in the cloud environment. Once the presented ECODL-IDSCS model is tested on benchmark dataset, the experimental results show the promising performance of the ECODL-IDSCS model over the existing IDS models. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

Therefore, it is necessary to classify the existing crime prediction algorithms and compare in depth the attributes and conditions that play an essential role in the analysis of crime prediction algorithms. Existing crime prediction methods can be roughly divided into two categories: those based on conventional machine learning and those based on contemporary deep learning. This survey analyses the fundamental theories and procedures. The most frequently used data sets are then enumerated, and the fundamental procedures of various algorithms are also analyzed in this paper. In light of the insufficient scale of existing data in this field, the ambiguity of data types used to predict crimes, and the absence of public data sets that have a significant impact on the research of algorithm models, this survey proposes the construction of a machine learning-based big data research model to address these issues.

With increased progression of city high-rise construction, accurate prediction has become ever more important. Many factors, such as local climates, roughness of surrounding conditions, and terrain, may affect wind speed. But among all factors considered, terrain has a very large influence. Difficulties in reflecting the influence of terrain on wind speed include (1) collecting topographic data information; (2) quantitatively evaluating terrain features; and (3) expressing specific area relationships with surrounding observation stations. This paper poses means to solve these limitations by (1) using satellite imagery to gather topographic information; (2) evaluating terrain quantitatively with convolutional neural network (CNN)-based encoders; and (3) employing a graph neural network (GNN) to estimate the wind speed relationship of an arbitrary place to that of observation stations.

These two contexts are separately considered in prior studies, despite their interaction. This study proposes a novel approach for technology opportunity discovery with a hybrid perspective using a technology ecology. It reflects technological contexts such as collaboration, competition, or technological association. We represent interactive relations between assignees, inventors, patents and technology areas via knowledge graphs, which are merged into a technology ecology. We focus on the relation between assignee and technology area nodes which indicates the assignee adopted technology opportunities related to the area. Further, to find the clues on new links, we analyze common neighboring nodes and position of the two nodes with network metrics. Next, we use them in a machine learning-based link prediction model, thereby identifying new technology areas likely to be linked to a firm of interest as technology opportunity candidates. They are evaluated in terms of the firm's internal context and external context and ranked via the TOPSIS method. The case study covering a technology-based firm in the biotechnology domain showed the applicability and feasibility of our approach. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Knowledge graphs; Link prediction; Machine learning; Technology ecology; Technology opportunity discovery,Article,Scopus

The existing approaches used in the wafer map pattern classification include directly learning the image through a convolution neural network and applying the ensemble method after extracting image features. This study aims to classify wafer map defects more effectively and derive robust algorithms even for datasets with insufficient defect patterns. First, the number of defects during the actual process may be limited. Therefore, insufficient data are generated using convolutional auto-encoder (CAE), and the expanded data are verified using the evaluation technique of structural similarity index measure (SSIM). After extracting handcrafted features, a boosted stacking ensemble model that integrates the four base-level classifiers with the extreme gradient boosting classifier as a meta-level classifier is designed and built for training the model based on the expanded data for final prediction. Since the proposed algorithm shows better performance than those of existing ensemble classifiers even for insufficient defect patterns, the results of this study will contribute to improving the product quality and yield of the actual semiconductor manufacturing process. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

Cloud computing and fog computing, two of the most common technologies used in IoT applications, have led to major security concerns. Cyberattacks are on the rise as a result of the usage of these technologies since present security measures are insufficient. Several artificial intelligence (AI) based security solutions, such as intrusion detection systems (IDS), have been proposed in recent years. Intelligent technologies that require data preprocessing and machine learning algorithm-performance augmentation require the use of feature selection (FS) techniques to increase classification accuracy by minimizing the number of features selected. On the other hand, metaheuristic optimization algorithms have been widely used in feature selection in recent decades. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid optimization algorithm for feature selection in IDS. The proposed algorithm is based on grey wolf (GW), and dipper throated optimization (DTO) algorithms and is referred to as GWDTO. The proposed algorithm has a better balance between the exploration and exploitation steps of the optimization process and thus could achieve better performance. On the employed IoT-IDS dataset, the performance of the proposed GWDTO algorithm was assessed using a set of evaluation metrics and compared to other optimization approaches in the literature to validate its superiority. In addition, a statistical analysis is performed to assess the stability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Various approaches have been employed to identify the source of Botnet at earlier stages.

The examination of images captured during biopsies plays an important role in determining whether a patient has cancer or not. However, the stochastic patterns, varying intensities of colors, and the large sizes of these images make it challenging to identify and mark malignant regions in them. Against this backdrop, this study proposes an approach to the pixel categorization based on the genetic algorithm (GA) and principal component analysis (PCA). The spatial features of the images were extracted using various filters, and the most prevalent ones are selected using the GA and fed into the classifiers for pixel-level categorization. Three classifiers—random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and extra tree (ET)—were used in the proposed model. The parameters of all models were separately tuned, and their performance was tested. The results show that the features extracted by using the GA+PCA in the proposed model are influential and reliable for pixel-level classification in service of the image annotation and tumor identification. Further, an image from benign, malignant, and normal classes was randomly selected and used to test the proposed model. The proposed model GA-PCA-DT has delivered accuracies between 0.99 to 1.0 on a reduced feature set. The predicted pixel sets were also compared with their respective ground-truth values to assess the overall performance of the method on two metrics—the universal image quality index (UIQI) and the structural similarity index (SSI).

Due to the resource constraints and open nature of IoT nodes, the routing protocol for low power and lossy (RPL) networks may be vulnerable to several routing attacks. That’s why a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is needed to guard against routing assaults on RPL-based IoT networks. The imbalance between the false and valid attacks in the training set degrades the performance of machine learning employed to detect network attacks. Therefore, we propose in this paper a novel approach to balance the dataset classes based on metaheuristic optimization applied to locality-sensitive hashing and synthetic minority oversampling technique (LSH-SMOTE). The proposed optimization approach is based on a new hybrid between the grey wolf and dipper throated optimization algorithms. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a set of experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of NIDS for three cases, namely, detection without dataset balancing, detection with SMOTE balancing, and detection with the proposed optimized LSHSOMTE balancing. Experimental results showed that the proposed approach outperforms the other approaches and could boost the detection accuracy. In addition, a statistical analysis is performed to study the significance and stability of the proposed approach.

To identify cross-site scripting attacks quickly and accurately, we proposed a cross-site scripting detection model (C-BLA) with two-channel multi-scale feature fusion embedded in a self-attention mechanism. The model first maps cross-site scripting payloads into spatial vectors by data preprocessing using Word2Vec. Then the two-channel network performs feature extraction on the data. Channel I: extract local features of cross-site scripting payloads at different scales by designing parallel one-dimensional convolutional layers with different convolutional kernel sizes; Channel II: extract semantic information of cross-site scripting payloads from two directions of positive and negative order using a bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory network, and then embed the self-attention mechanism to strengthen the semantic information features. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves a precision rate of 99.8% and a recall rate of 99.1% for cross-site scripting detection, which is a certain improvement in detection rate compared with a single deep learning model and traditional machine learning methods.

These ECT (ensemble clustering based transformation) techniques, i.e., ECT-Subspace, ECT-Noise and ECT-Combined, are developed using the concept of ensemble clustering and three different ensemble generation strategies, i.e., random feature subspace, feature noise injection and their combinations. Based on the empirical study with published dataset and four classification algorithms, new models usually outperform that original wrapper and other filter alternatives found in the literature. This is similarly summarized from the first experiment with basic classification of legitimate and direct attacks, and the second that focuses on recognizing obfuscated intrusions. In addition, analysis of algorithmic parameters, i.e., ensemble size and level of noise, is provided as a guideline for a practical use. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

The interconnectivity of networks has brought various complexities in maintaining network availability, consistency, and discretion. Machine learning based intrusion detection systems have become essential to monitor network traffic for malicious and illicit activities. An intrusion detection system controls the flow of network traffic with the help of computer systems. Various deep learning algorithms in intrusion detection systems have played a prominent role in identifying and analyzing intrusions in network traffic. For this purpose, when the network traffic encounters known or unknown intrusions in the network, a machine-learning framework is needed to identify and/or verify network intrusion. The Intrusion detection scheme empowered with a fused machine learning technique (IDS-FMLT) is proposed to detect intrusion in a heterogeneous network that consists of different source networks and to protect the network from malicious attacks.

Open attacks and unauthorized access are possible with these IoT devices, which exchange data to enable remote access. These attacks are often detected using intrusion detection methodologies, although these systems’ effectiveness and accuracy are subpar. This paper proposes a new voting classifier composed of an ensemble of machine learning models trained and optimized using metaheuristic optimization. The employed metaheuristic optimizer is a new version of the whale optimization algorithm (WOA), which is guided by the dipper throated optimizer (DTO) to improve the exploration process of the traditional WOA optimizer. The proposed voting classifier categorizes the network intrusions robustly and efficiently. To assess the proposed approach, a dataset created from IoT devices is employed to record the efficiency of the proposed algorithm for binary attack categorization. The dataset records are balanced using the locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). The evaluation of the achieved results is performed in terms of statistical analysis and visual plots to prove the proposed approach’s effectiveness, stability, and significance.

For this purpose, several approaches have been applied to exploit this mass of data, among them the deep learning approach, which has demonstrated its performance against classical machine learning algorithms since 2006. However, this approach inherited the same problems as those of classical machine learning, namely the heterogeneity of the resources (most of the time, the data are not directly exploitable, they must be sorted, filtered and normalized) dedicated to learning, but also in most cases the available resources are reduced in size for some languages and dialects which affects the performance of the models in training. The aim of this paper is to study the impact of normalization and data augmentation on named entity recognition (NER) task on Algerian text, using Arabic pre-trained models. For training and evaluation, we built a corpus dedicated to the recognition of named entities, called DzNER, based on Facebook’s comments. To evaluate the models, we set up 4 scenarios, the first one without normalization and data augmentation, in this case, the ARBERT model outperformed the other models with an F1 score of 84.4%. The second scenario is to use normalization, which enabled the Dziribert model to get the highest F1 Score of 81.9%. The third scenario with data augmentation, where the Arabert v0.2 model yielded the best F1 score with 85.1%. The Arabert v0.2 model again obtained the best F1 Score with 86.2% in the last scenario combining normalization and data augmentation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Algerian dialect; Data augmentation; Deep learning; NER; Normalization,Conference Paper,Scopus

The places that humans share with robots are called human-robot collaboration (HRC) workspaces. To ensure the safety in HRC workspaces, a collision-avoidance system is required. In this paper, we regard the collision-avoidance as a problem during the robot action trajectory design and propose an intelligent robotic arm path planning (IRAP2) framework. The IRAP2 framework is based on the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm because the path planning is a typical continuous control problem in a dynamic environment, and DDPG is well suited for such problems. To test the IRAP2 framework, we have studied a HRC workspace in which the robot size is larger than humans. At first, we have applied a physics engine to build a virtual HRC workspace including digital models of a robot and a human. Using this virtual HRC workspace as the environment model, we further trained an agent model using the DDPG algorithm. The trained model can optimize the motion path of the robot to avoid collision with the human. © 2023, The Author(s).",Deep deterministic policy gradient; Human-robot collaboration; Path planning; Reinforcement learning,Conference Paper,Scopus

However, the highly imbalanced flow distribution often hinders the machine learning algorithm's performance. In this paper, streamflow forecasting was approached through the formulation of two distinct machine learning problems: categorical streamflow forecast and regression streamflow forecast. Due to the distinctive characteristics of these two adopted forms, selecting the correct algorithm for the machine learning problem along with their hyperparameter tuning process is critical to the realization of the desired results. For the distinct streamflow formulated scenarios, three neural network algorithms and their hyperparameter tuning strategy were investigated. The comparative empirical studies had revealed that formulated categorical-based streamflow forecast is a better choice than a regression-based streamflow forecast, regardless of the algorithms used; for instance, the f1-score of 0.7 (categorical based) is obtained compared to the 0.53 (regression based) for the LSTM in scenario 1 (binary). Furthermore, forest-based algorithms were investigated and shown to be superior at forecasting high streamflow fluctuations in situations featuring low-dimensional streamflow input. Besides, encoding the streamflow time series as images (input) for forecasting purposes would require a thorough analysis as there is a discrepancy in the results, revealing that not all approaches are suitable for streamflow image transformation. The functional ANOVA analysis provided evidence to substantiate the Bayesian optimization results, implying that the hyperparameters were effectively optimized. © 2022, The Author(s).",Deep learning algorithms; Hyperparameter optimization; Machine learning algorithms; Streamflow forecasting,Article,Scopus

Hybrid strategies use numerical and monitoring data together to improve the learning process of the algorithms. The numerical models, such as finite-element (FE) models, are used for data augmentation based on the assumption of the existence of limited experimental data sets. However, a numerical model might fail in providing reliable data, as its parameters might not share the same underlying operating conditions observed in real situations. Meanwhile, the concept of transfer learning has evolved in SHM, in particular through domain adaptation techniques. The ability to adapt a classifier built on a well-known labeled data set to a new scenario with an unlabeled data set is an opportunity to transit bridge SHM from research to practice. Therefore, this paper proposes an unsupervised transfer learning approach for bridges with a domain adaptation technique, where classifiers are trained only with labeled data generated from FE models (source domain). Then, unlabeled monitoring data (target domain) are used to test the classification performance. As numerical and monitoring data are related to the same bridge, both domains are assumed to have similar statistical distributions, with slight differences caused by the uncertainties inherent to the FE models. The domain adaptation is performed using a transfer knowledge method called transfer component analysis, which transforms damage-sensitive features from the original space to a new one, called latent space, where the differences between feature distributions are reduced. This approach may increase the use of numerical modeling for long-term monitoring, as it overcomes some of the limitations imposed by the calibration process of FE models. The efficiency of this unsupervised approach is illustrated through the classification performance of classifiers built on source data with and without domain adaptation, and using the benchmark data sets from the Z-24 Bridge as the target data. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,Article,Scopus

Reverse time migration (RTM) based on the two-way wave propagator has a high resolution and avoids the issues associated with one-way wave propagators; however, it has a high computational cost in practical applications. We develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) application mode that improves one migration method by learning from another one and design a CNN with a structure similar to U-net that combines the advantages of both migration methods. The CNN label is the RTM result, and the corresponding input is the result of one-way wave migration with a generalized screen propagator (GSP). The trained CNN model improves the amplitude in the one-way wave migration image and removes the errors caused by large lateral velocity perturbations. Moreover, by maintaining the high migration calculation efficiency, our CNN model allows for a high resolution, few artifacts, and accurate images of steep structures in the one-way wave migration result. With our method, the accuracy of the one-way wave migration result is close to that of the RTM result. The use of GSP-based migration in our CNN model rather than conventional RTM to generate prospecting images can considerably reduce the calculation costs. © 2023 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.",high resolution; machine learning; migration; one way; reverse time migration,Article,Scopus

All this can be possible due to the introduction of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and complex sensors that are capable of communicating with each other creating a form of a digital environment, helping in making the cities autonomous. The emergence of big data and advanced machine learning techniques can detect anomalies and alterations that are otherwise not possible with the human eye.

A smart city is a collection of basic amenities provided in a smart, efficient, and eco-friendly manner that is interconnected and provides real-time feedback such as traffic management, pollution control, waste management, health care, etc. In this chapter, we discuss the underlying technology, their implementation, and the working of a model for the creation of a self-sustained smart city. The purpose of a smart city could be achieved if it is sustainable, self-reliant, and autonomous. For that, a novel smart city central management system (SCAS) is introduced in the chapter to administer and cater to the city with minimal intervention of a human.

The fields of application for textile products are diverse. Although the technologies for manufacturing textiles are extensively researched, the industry is still highly dependent on expert knowledge. To date, manual process- and machine adjustments and quality control are the norms rather than the exception. Heat setting is used in the process chain to dissolve or selectively introduce tensions from the weaving or knitting process and to prepare the products for digital printing. The correct setting of the machine depends on a large number of different materials-, processes- & environmental parameters. For each product, the machine has to be set up again by an experienced textile engineer. To ease the training for new workers and shorten the machine setting process, this study aims to use machine learning to facilitate and objectify the setting of the heat-setting process. Machine parameters are generated using an invertible neural network (INN) based on pre-defined target parameters.

The analysis is carried out through the Lean Manufacturing Lab at KTH, a learning factory supporting the traditional educational activities. In the lab, the students assemble a product on an assembly line; during three rounds, they identify problems on the line, apply the appropriate lean tools to overcome the problems, and try to achieve a higher productivity. The study is based on the analysis of the times recorded during the sessions of the lab. A questionnaire submitted to the students after the course evaluates the level of knowledge of lean production principles that the students achieved. The results are twofold: the improvement of the assembly times through the implementation of the lean tools and the positive effect of a hands-on experience on the students’ understanding of the lean principles, highlighted by the answers to the questionnaire.

The embankment response was predicted directly through Gibbs sampling, which involves an iterative encoding and decoding process in the variational autoencoder. The variational autoencoder was trained using simulated embankment responses from the numerical (Plaxis) model. The approach was applied at the Ballina site to predict the embankment response, based on monitoring data with varying time periods. The prediction intervals captured the actual trends satisfactorily, with the intervals becoming more aligned with actual values as more monitoring data were incorporated. The predictions were also more reasonable, compared to those based entirely on representative soil parameters from laboratory or in-situ tests. The variational autoencoder was also applied to another case involving synthetic monitoring data based on the Ballina site, which demonstrates the capability of the variational autoencoder to predict multiple scenarios of embankment behavior. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Consolidation; Embankments; Machine Learning; Monitoring; Neural networks; Observational method,Article,Scopus

Road monitoring assesses the road’s condition for later analysis, which helps the prioritization of maintenance activities. Optimizing the process of scheduling and prioritizing maintenance activities is driven by cost-efficiency and is critical for preserving the overall road networks’ health and smooth operation. However, the implementation of road monitoring, using traditional equipment such as profilometers, total stations, and automated road meters, could be exceedingly time-consuming. This research proposes the usage of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and dynamic vehicle accelerations to reconstruct road defects in a time/cost-effective manner. A multi-degree of freedom numerical model is used to simulate the dynamics of a vehicle passing on various road defects such as potholes and speed bumps. These road defects are reconstructed by using two different methods. The first method employs a frequency domain approach to inversely reconstruct the road defects numerically. The second method uses ANNs to reconstruct the road defects with time histories of the vehicle’s acceleration as the input to the network. The ANN model was trained by dynamic vehicle accelerations as inputs and various road defect profiles as outputs. Both methods were later compared on the basis of their accuracy and efficiency, and the ANN method was found to be more promising for implementation on experimental data. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Artificial neural network; Machine learning; Road defects; Vibrations,Conference Paper,Scopus

In the past, damage identification was performed through periodical inspection, non-destructive testing/non-destructive evaluation, or visual observation. Structural health monitoring (SHM) has emerged to transition from offline damage identification to near real-time and online damage assessment. Hence, SHM is a damage detection strategy to monitor a structure for a period using a series of continuous measurement devices, which then collect the system’s characteristics and subsequently perform statistical analysis to assess the current circumstances and health of the structure. One of the first steps for the study of SHM is damage detection followed by monitoring. Machine Learning (ML) techniques can be used to develop viable algorithms to make potential predictions. ML algorithms are therefore providing the tools needed to enhance the capabilities of SHM systems and provide intelligent solutions to past challenges. Preliminary studies have reviewed that the extension of ML into SHM has dramatically increased the system’s capabilities, providing innovative solutions to different research challenges.

In this study, three types of pristine biochar (BCs: PBC300, PBC500, and PBC700) were prepared using agricultural waste shiitake mushroom bran at different pyrolysis temperatures to remove TC from water. The structure and surface chemistry of the adsorbents were characterized using different analytical techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis. These changes in physicochemical properties improve the adsorption capacity of BC. The PBC300 and PBC500 conform to the Langmuir isothermal adsorption model, while the PBC700 is more compatible with the Freundlich model. According to the fitting results of the Langmuir isotherm model, the maximum saturated adsorption capacities of PBC300, PBC500 and PBC700 for TC were 7.568 mg/g, 14.994 mg/g and 17.684 mg/g, respectively. The correlation coefficients of the pseudo-second-order kinetic models were 0.9882, 0.9882 and 0.9996, respectively, which could well fit the adsorption process of TC by the three BCs, indicating that chemical adsorption was dominant. With the help of machine learning, the relationship between the physicochemical properties of BC and the adsorption capacity of TC was effectively explored. The random forest model was able to fit the adsorption process of BC on TC better. It is expected that this study will guide the rational application of BC in the treatment of TC wastewater. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Antibiotic; Biochar; Machine learning; Sorptive removal; Water pollution,Article,Scopus

The use of electroencephalogram (EEG) as a tool to support the diagnosis of patients with epilepsy is fundamental. Today, machine learning (ML) techniques are widely applied in neuroscience. The main objective of our study is to differentiate patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy from healthy controls by applying machine learning techniques on interictal electroencephalographic recordings. Our research predicts which patients have idiopathic generalized epilepsy from a scalp EEG study. In addition, this study focuses on using the extreme gradient boosting (XGB) method applied to scalp EEG. XGB is one of the variants of gradient boosting and is a supervised learning algorithm. This type of system is developed to increase performance and processing speed. Through this proposed method, an attempt is made to recognize patterns from scalp EEG recordings that would allow the detection of IGE with high accuracy and differentiate IGE patients from healthy controls, creating an additional tool to support clinicians in their decision-making. Among the ML methods applied, the proposed XGB method achieves a better prediction of the distinct features in EEG signals from patients with IGE. XGB was 6.26% more accurate than the k-Nearest Neighbours method and was more accurate than the support vector machine (10.61%), decision tree (9.71%) and Gaussian Naïve Bayes (11.83%). Besides, the proposed XGB method showed the highest area under the curve (AUC 98%) and balanced accuracy (98.13%) of all methods tested. Application of ML technique in EEG of patients with epilepsy is very recent and is emerging with promising results. In this research work, we showed the usefulness of ML techniques to identify and predict generalized epilepsy from healthy controls in scalp EEG studies. These findings could help develop automated tools that integrate these ML techniques to assist clinicians in differentiating between patients with IGE from healthy controls in daily practice. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Epilepsy; Extreme gradient boosting; Idiopathic generalized epilepsy; Machine learning; Scalp EEG,Article,Scopus

In grapevines, it causes Botrytis bunch rot (BBR), one of the most reported diseases worldwide. It affects all herbaceous organs of the vine, especially the ripe berries, causing significant reductions in yield and wine quality. Botrytis detection models traditionally focus on temporal analysis at a specific spatial location, ignoring the study of the spatial variability of the crop. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with multispectral cameras can provide high-resolution images that can be valuable information to develop a tool for aerial pest detection. This paper proposes an algorithm to assess the risk of Botrytis development in a vineyard in Spain, using as input products generated by UAV imagery: DTM (Digital Terrain Model), NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index), CHM (Canopy Height Model) and LAI (Leaf Area Index). They represent the height and architecture of the canopy, the topography and the plant status. Healthy vines were significantly different from vines affected by Botrytis (p < 0.05) in each of these variables, supporting the consistency of using these inputs for the model. This methodology combines photogrammetric, spatial analysis techniques, and machine learning classification methods with deep vineyard-related agronomic knowledge to produce heatmaps with acceptable accuracy (R² > 0.7) that may support vineyard managers in understanding the spatial variability of the disease, allowing the spatial 2D visualisation of the risk of BBR disease development and, potentially, resulting in higher operational efficiency and reducing phytosanitary treatments, as well as economic costs. Furthermore, the present work takes advantage of imaging technologies that provide information about any location in the field, not only about specific points in the vineyard, suggesting that UAV imagery is appropriate to measure the likelihood of BBR development within the vineyard, highlighting the importance of efficient disease management based on spatial variability. © 2022 The Authors",Disease detection; Multispectral; NDVI; Risk; UAV,Article,Scopus

As their remarkable generalization capabilities are primarily enabled by their projection-based attribute, in this paper, we investigate connections with low-rank techniques derived from the singular value decomposition (SVD). We demonstrate that some of the concepts behind proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-neural networks can improve DeepONet's design and training phases. These ideas lead us to a methodology extension that we name SVD-DeepONet. Moreover, through multiple SVD analyses of scenario- and time-aggregated snapshots matrices, we find that DeepONet inherits from its projection-based attribute strong inefficiencies in representing dynamics characterized by symmetries. Inspired by the work on shifted-POD, we develop flexDeepONet, an architecture enhancement that relies on a pre-transformation network for generating a moving reference frame and isolating the rigid components of the dynamics. In this way, the physics can be represented on a latent space free from rotations, translations, and stretches, and an accurate projection can be performed to a low-dimensional basis. In addition to improving DeepONet's flexibility and interpretability, the proposed perspectives increase its generalization capabilities and computational efficiencies. For instance, we show flexDeepONet can accurately surrogate the dynamics of 19 thermodynamic variables in a combustion chemistry application by relying on 95% fewer trainable parameters than that of the ‘vanilla’ architecture. As stressed in the paper, we argue that DeepONet and SVD-based methods can reciprocally benefit from each other. In particular, the flexibility of the former in leveraging multiple data sources and multifidelity knowledge in the form of both unstructured data and physics-informed constraints has the potential to greatly extend the applicability of methodologies such as POD and principal component analysis (PCA). © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Combustion; DeepONet; Neural operators; POD with symmetries; Scientific machine learning; SVD,Article,Scopus

As an important resource for porosity quantification, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) well-logs are extremely useful; they allow geologists and petrophysicists to rapidly quantify different types of porosities (including total, effective, and free fluid porosity), and to perform a full formation evaluation and a reservoir quality analysis. However, the activation of wireline tools, the signal-to-noise ratio, the environmental conditions, and the characteristics of the formation fluid can create expensive and adverse conditions for subsurface acquisition. This research aims to develop machine learning models for the creation of synthetic NMR well-logs, assisted by auxiliary well-logging features. Four supervised models: multilayer perceptron neural network, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and CatBoost, comparing the adjusted R2 and RMSE. Of these, the CatBoost regressor provided the most highly optimized model. It was able to reduce local dissimilarities with the real dataset, and returned a better global metric score, yielding an adjusted R2 of 0.87 and an RMSE of less than 0.01. Moreover, all of the machine learning models provided substantial improvements in total porosity estimation, particularly compared to conventional empirical calculations based on density and sonic well-logs. An improvement of 0.5520 in the adjusted R2 was achieved for the density porosity, and 0.2 for the sonic porosity. The differences between real NMR well-logs and the machine learning outputs were in general less than 5%, for most of the well-logging interval. In addition, a tree boosted porosity model based on well-logs is presented for the first time, and the contributions and impacts of the input features on the model predictions are explored. Finally, the behaviors of the linear and nonlinear features of the model are examined, which allows us to better understand the complex relationships among the features and the dataset used. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Explainable machine learning; Features contribution; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Synthetic well-logs; Well-log porosity prediction,Article,Scopus

A lot of attention has been devoted to the reasons influencing individual voting decisions, with some progress in understanding within-country variation in the vote. But these studies usually assume that perceptions coincide with objective reality. This article addresses this shortcoming, using quantitative text analysis and spatial econometrics to show that local narratives – sometimes more than contextual statistics – can drive spatial differences in the populist vote. Taking Spain as an example, I train a machine learning algorithm to determine the prevalence of given news topics across the national territory based on how many related articles local newspapers published on Twitter in the year before the last national election. I then use spatial econometric techniques to link these results to local divergences in support for the radical right party VOX. The analysis sheds some light onto the economic anxiety - cultural backlash - geography of discontent debate. The empirical evidence supports the notion that narratives about economic anxiety and regional gaps matter, but also shows that narratives about separatism played a key role in the rise of the radical right in Spain. © 2022 The Author(s)",Local newspapers; Machine learning algorithm; Radical right support; Spain; Twitter,Article,Scopus

In this study, a novel integrated forecasting model of the air quality index (AQI) is suggested to carry out reliable prediction, providing useful references for urban air pollution control, public health construction, and residents' travel planning. Firstly, the original data is decomposed by the method of complementary set empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD), and the subsequences of different frequencies are formed. Secondly, the fuzzy entropy (FE) algorithm is used to reconstruct the subsequence. Then, the combined forecasting model is established, and different prediction methods are selected for different frequency subsequences. The new high-frequency sequences, low-frequency sequences, and trend sequences are predicted by the whale algorithm optimized long short term neural network (WOA-LSTM) and the extreme learning machine (ELM), respectively. Empirical analysis are carried out with the example of Beijing and Chengdu. The results indicated that: (1) The proposed CEEMD—FE—WOA-LSTM—ELM model effectively integrates the characteristics of the original sequence and has the highest prediction accuracy among all the comparison models. (2) It is necessary to preprocess the data, which can effectively extract data features. Taking Beijing as an example, compared with the non-decomposition model, after adding the decomposition algorithm, the prediction accuracy rate (PA) is increased by 8.55% on average, the RMSE is decreased by 10.36 on average, and the MAPE is decreased by 6.11% on average. (3) The overall prediction level and prediction accuracy can be effectively increased by applying various prediction methods for recombination sequences with various frequency. The research results can provide references for urban air quality prediction. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Air quality index; Combined forecasting model; Complementary set empirical mode decomposition; Fuzzy entropy,Article,Scopus

But the raw S2S precipitation forecasts are rather limited regarding their predictive skills, which hinders further hydrological applications. Many previous studies were carried out to validate the S2S precipitation forecasts from the perspective of the ensemble “mean”, while existing study, which evaluates and improves the ability of S2S forecasts in predicting extreme precipitation events with their ensemble spreads, is rarely reported. This study aims to improve the S2S forecasts in predicting the occurrence of weekly extreme precipitation events above 99% over the contiguous United States (CONUS). The Random Forest Classifiers (RF) were employed and additional forecasts variables (i.e., surface air temperature, geopotential heights at 500 hPa and 850 hPa) were included to post-process the raw S2S forecasts from the NASA's Goddard Earth Observation System model version five (GEOS5). Different RF training inputs and RF hyperparameter sensitivity analysis are examined. We found that (1) using S2S precipitation forecast as the only inputs to RF, the forecast quality is improved significantly only at week 1; (2) When additional forecasts variables are included in RF training, the forecast skill tend to improve slightly at longer lead times after weeks 2; (3) The tunning of the maximum tree depth of RFs combine with the inclusion of additional forecasts variables as inputs to RF can improve the forecasts skill at all lead times over CONUS. In short, this study demonstrated the effectiveness of the application of RF as well as the effectiveness of additional forecast variables in improving the S2S extreme precipitation forecasts, which could be potentially useful for flood and river ensemble forecasting. Multiple statistical metrics, including the ensemble probability of detections (EPOD), ensemble false alarm ratios (EFAR), ensemble critical success index (ECSI), Brier Sill Score (BSS), and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curves (AUROC) are employed for a comprehensive evaluation of the predictive performances of S2S extreme precipitation forecasts under different experiment scenarios. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",CONUS; Ensemble forecast; Extreme; Machine learning; Precipitation; S2S,Article,Scopus

It is common knowledge that kNN is one of the most popular supervised classification algorithm. However, for large data collections, the classification is time consuming because of the distance calculations which increase with the number of training samples and the data dimensionality. To reduce the number of training samples, we propose two techniques that employ the notions of convex envelope and stratified sampling. For the convex envelope, only the data points building the convex hull will serve as designated prototypes (training samples), thus reducing considerably the computational burden. To reduce the dimensionality of the data, we considered auto-encoder networks and vector embedding. The former is learning a way to compact data representation using statistical machine learning and the latter is changing the data itself emphasizing how each data sample is organized in space compared to others. The experiments on multiple benchmark data collections such as MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and Lampung characters show a considerable classification speed up (up to 32×) with no significant drop in accuracy when compared to results obtained using the complete data. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Autoencoder network; Character recognition; Classification; Convex envelope; Digit recognition; k-Nearest neighbor; Stratified sampling; Vector embedding,Article,Scopus

In order to accurately predict daily water level time series without sufficient data despite the need for large training data sets for neural networks, this paper proposes an innovative daily water level forecasting model, ECRBM-GRU-SSA, which combines the enhanced continuous restricted Boltzmann machine (ECRBM), the gated recurrent neural unit (GRU), and the sparrow search algorithm (SSA). The ECRBM extracts input features and then cooperates with the ensemble strategy to increase the generalization ability of the final model. SSA adjusts model parameters. The contribution of each component to the final prediction result is analyzed using daily water level meteorological data from the Qingxi River.

This study was conducted to evaluate the role of Radiomics in differentiating these two conditions in adults. Materials and methods: After a retrospective search of our institutional imaging archive, adult patients with a known diagnosis of PA or HB were included. We reviewed each patient's most recent preoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The solid enhancing nodule of each lesion on post-contrast T1 sequence was manually segmented. Multiple Radiomics features were then extracted from each nodule using the Pyradiomics library. Subsequently, the most predictive features were identified by feature selection models. Following this, different machine learning (ML) models were constructed based on these selected features to classify lesions as PA or HB. Finally, we evaluated the performance of each model by leave-one-out cross-validation. Results: With inclusion and exclusion criteria, 34 enhancing PA nodules and 39 HB nodules were selected. A total of 115 features were extracted from each enhancing nodule. Twelve characteristics were detected as most predictive of histopathological diagnosis. Among various ML models, the neural network had the best performance in differentiating these two conditions with an AUC of 0.9 and an accuracy of 82%. Conclusions: In this retrospective study, Radiomics MRI techniques demonstrated high performance in distinguishing adult posterior fossa PA from HB. Future development of Radiomics models may advance presurgical diagnosis of these two conditions when added to routine clinical practice and thus improve patient management. © 2022",Artificial intelligence; Hemangioblastoma; Magnetic resonance imaging; Pilocytic astrocytoma,Article,Scopus

Operators should supply enough reactive power by identifying influential factors and generating accurate forecasts for reactive power demand. Therefore, the scientific community concentrates more on reactive power consumption and brings increasing technical works, but related publications are still far from expectations compared with active power forecasting publications. In this context, this paper proposes a short-term reactive power forecasting scheme for residents. First, we reveal the uniqueness of the short-range residential household reactive power forecasting problem in distribution systems. Then, we customize an attention-based Transformer sequence-to-sequence network (Seq2Seq Net) to capture the volatility and uncertainty of reactive power sequential readings and improve the pressing accurate residential reactive power demand forecasts. The customized Transformer Seq2Seq Net can take advantage of the observed, known and static covariate factors, where the encoder-decoder architecture captures short-term memory, the attention mechanism captures long-term temporal dependencies, and gating residual connections augment the non-linear processing capability. In addition, we model the interactions between active and reactive power demand by incorporating a multi-task learning structure. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed solution by comparing hour- and day-ahead forecasts generated by the solution, benchmarks (i.e., one-hour, one-day, and one-week hold), comparative data-driven methods including machine learning (e.g., gradient boosting decision tree) and deep learning (e.g., temporal convolutional networks), and ablative models (that considers varying conditions in the scheme). The results showed that the hour-ahead forecasts generated by the proposed solution can reduce up to 188.2% error among multiple evaluation criteria, such as mean absolute error (MAE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), normalized mean absolute percentage error (NMAPE), and Theil inequality coefficient (TIC), and that the day-ahead forecasts decrease up to 273.2% error, with the acceptable time costs on optimizing the model parameters and producing forecasts, illustrating the feasibility of the scheme. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Attention mechanism; Household reactive power forecasting; Multi-task learning; Residential load forecasting; Sequence-to-sequence neural network; Transformer neural network,Article,Scopus

The spatial distribution of paddy-rice emissions has been assessed at regional-to-global scales by bottom-up inventories and land surface models over coarse spatial resolution (e.g., &gt; 0.5°) or spatial units (e.g., agro-ecological zones). However, high-resolution CH4 flux estimates capable of capturing the effects of local climate and management practices on emissions, as well as replicating in situ data, remain challenging to produce because of the scarcity of high-resolution maps of paddy-rice and insufficient understanding of CH4 predictors. Here, we combine paddy-rice methane-flux data from 23 global eddy covariance sites and MODIS remote sensing data with machine learning to 1) evaluate data-driven model performance and variable importance for predicting rice CH4 fluxes; and 2) produce gridded up-scaling estimates of rice CH4 emissions at 5000-m resolution across Monsoon Asia, where ?87% of global rice area is cultivated and ? 90% of global rice production occurs. Our random-forest model achieved Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values of 0.59 and 0.69 for 8-day CH4 fluxes and site mean CH4 fluxes respectively, with land surface temperature, biomass and water-availability-related indices as the most important predictors. We estimate the average annual (winter fallow season excluded) paddy rice CH4 emissions throughout Monsoon Asia to be 20.6 ± 1.1 Tg yr?1 for 2001–2015, which is at the lower range of previous inventory-based estimates (20–32 CH4 Tg yr?1). Our estimates also suggest that CH4 emissions from paddy rice in this region have been declining from 2007 through 2015 following declines in both paddy-rice growing area and emission rates per unit area, suggesting that CH4 emissions from paddy rice in Monsoon Asia have likely not contributed to the renewed growth of atmospheric CH4 in recent years. © 2022 The Authors",Climate change; Eddy covariance; Greenhouse gas emission; Machine learning; Remote sensing,Article,Scopus

In this context, using costly spectrometry equipment that was not adapted to be operated remotely, was not an option. In this paper we describe how we adapted our low-cost spectrometry technology (which is based on a 3D-printed mini-spectrometer and a smartphone) to deploy a remote laboratory as a rapid solution, due to the impossibility of using conventional and costly spectrometers, which work only for on-campus learning. This adaptation was helpful, not only to have several spectrometers available for a higher number of students, but also to allow teachers to prepare asynchronous activities that can be realized without their presence.

Predicting patients’ lung cancer survivability has become a trendy research topic by scholars from medicine and computer science domains. In this article, a novel approach to the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is proposed for the precise and automatic classification of lung cancer. Specifically, the auto weight dilated convolutional unit utilized multi-scale convolutional feature maps to acquire lung cancer features at different scales and employed a learnable set of parameters to fuse convolutional feature maps in encoding layers. The AD unit is an effective architecture for feature extraction in the encoding stage. We used the advantages of the U-Net network for deep and shallow features, combined with AD units to multimodal image classification. In this model, the four channel model inputs correspond to the CT images of four modes, respectively.

It is a routine virus test in a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. However, a test like this takes longer to complete because it follows the serial testing method, and there is a high chance of a false-negative ratio (FNR). Moreover, there arises a deficiency of R.T.-PCR test kits. Therefore, alternative procedures for a quick and accurate diagnosis of patients are urgently needed to deal with these pandemics. The infrared image is self-sufficient for detecting these diseases by measuring the temperature at the initial stage. C.T. scans and other pathological tests are valuable aspects of evaluating a patient with a suspected pandemic infection. However, a patient's radiological findings may not be identified initially. Therefore, we have included an Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) algorithm-based Machine Intelligence (MI) system in this proposal to combine C.T. scan findings with all other tests, symptoms, and history to quickly diagnose a patient with a positive symptom of current and future pandemic diseases. Initially, the system will collect information by an infrared camera of the patient's facial regions to measure temperature, keep it as a record, and complete further actions. We divided the face into eight classes and twelve regions for temperature measurement. A database named patient-info-mask is maintained. While collecting sample data, we incorporate a wireless network using a cloudlets server to make processing more accessible with minimal infrastructure. The system will use deep learning approaches. We propose convolution neural networks (CNN) to cross-verify the collected data. For better results, we incorporated tenfold cross-verification into the synthesis method. As a result, our new way of estimating became more accurate and efficient. We achieved 3.29% greater accuracy by incorporating the ""decision tree level synthesis method"" and ""ten-folded-validation method"".

Prior to investigating disease microbiome biomarkers, a healthy state of biomarkers needs to be established. These can vary based on different conditions (including gender). We used the currently available technology to try to discover the difference between the microbiome of a different gender as this can help guide personalized medicine. We trained a Random Forest classifier model that used fecal 16S rRNA sequence data to differentiate between male and female subjects based on the same age, BMI, country of residence, and diet. Before the classification process, bioinformatics analysis was performed using the QIIME2–2020.2 tool which resulted in profiling microbiome communities present in host organisms. The Alpha diversity test that was conducted afterward did not discover differences in male and female subjects. Prior to classification, feature selection has been performed using the forests of trees to evaluate the importance of features in the dataset. It was experimented with 95%, 90%, and 85% coverage of features for each classification run. 5-fold cross-validation yielded high accuracy results on multiple subsets (subjects in the 30s, subjects in the 40s, non-omnivores), going above 80%. Our results have shown that Random Forest, as a stable algorithm, can be modeled on microbiome data to achieve high precision (close to 90%) with relatively few parameters. This suggests that the microbiome of different genders is highly distinguishable, and that gender is a possible suitable marker for personalized decision-making in medicine that involves gut microbiome data. The new methods of analysis of gut microbiome data can be used to confirm these results with more precise analysis. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Gender; Gut microbiome; Machine learning; Personalized medicine; Random forest,Conference Paper,Scopus

Studying the Rashomon effect is important for understanding the causes of the unintended variability of results which originate from-* within the models and the XAI methods themselves. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Consistent ML explanations; ML; Model reliability; Rashomon effect; SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations); XAI; XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting),Conference Paper,Scopus

One of the most important factors is the noise. It can cause different kind of problems in Artificial Intelligence algorithms, as the learning model can interpret the noise as a data pattern. Because of this, reducing or eliminating the noise from a signal is a crucial process. This paper is focusing on treating the problem of signal denoising. A method to eliminate the noise from signals by using of a Convolutional denoising auto-encoder was developed. The developed autoencoder has six layers: an input layer, two convolutional layers serving as encoder, two convolutional layers as decoder and an output layer. One of the main advantages of this approach is that, compared to other methods used for denoising signals, autoencoders can be trained with the downstream classifier, improving the accuracy of the system. This introductory study will be extended and improved so that the autoencoder presented in this paper will to be able to eliminate thermal noise from a signal using a similar machine learning model. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Artificial intelligence; Autoencoder; Deep learning; Neural networks; Signal denoising,Conference Paper,Scopus

This results in Hepatitis C patients who are unaware of their condition until it worsens to become chronic liver diseases that are diagnosed through more costly or invasive methods–liver biopsy and radiology scans. Due to these limitations of the current methods of diagnosis, this study seeks to develop a machine learning model to diagnose patients with different stages of liver disease: hepatitis c, liver fibrosis, and cirrhosis. In this research, machine learning algorithms were applied to a dataset containing HCV patient information, and the algorithms were evaluated for their accuracy and performance in classifying the patients with the proper diagnosis. Findings from the study indicated that XGBoost can most accurately classify patients with an accuracy score of 95.48, but other algorithms used had high accuracy scores as well: the algorithm with the lowest accuracy score–Decision Tree–still had a score of 92.66. The second experiment also showed that the Isolation Forest algorithm could detect and isolate the suspect blood donors of the data with a relatively high accuracy of 93.22%. As both experiments of the study yielded a machine learning model of high accuracy, the algorithms used can be implemented into a diagnostic kit for liver disease to be used in developing countries where accessibility to current diagnosis tools is limited. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Diagnosis; HCV; Isolation forest; Machine learning; XG boosting,Conference Paper,Scopus

The entire system was locally developed which requires linking between a web application software and server software to ensure uninterrupted online communication during the remote activities. The physical interaction within the lab was realized via human interface machine and microcontroller which translate the command given by the user from the web into set of instructions to control and operate the lab. The current prototype has solved the persisting challenges in implementing web-based remote control systems namely data lagging and false data acquisition via the use of server systems and data transfer algorithms. This strategy ensures data integrity and reliability to be displayed to the user in real-time. A new robotic viewing system has been developed and incorporated within the laboratory infrastructure.

However, the crops are affected by many diseases during the cultivation process including rust and leaf spots that can destroy the crop after a month. This leads to a large degradation in wheat productivity rate. So, the crops need continuous observation during the agriculture process and need experts with the wheat leaf's nature. This is a time-consuming and expensive task. So, this paper aims to detect various types of leaf diseases to differentiate them from healthy crops without needing continuous crop monitoring and to minimize yield losses. The dataset used is a three-class wheat leaf dataset that consists of one healthy class and 2 leaf disease classes namely septoria and stripe rust.

Epilepsy is a common condition that affects the brain and causes frequent seizures. Seizures are bursts of electrical activity in the brain that temporarily affect how it works. Most of the people that suffer from epilepsy cannot predict when the seizure is going to occur. If seizure occurs for example, when someone is driving, or when the patient is climbing the stairs, outcome could be fatal for the patient. Also, patients do not always know that they experienced a seizure, due to memory loss during the seizure itself. Commonly used method for detecting seizures is video electroencephalography. This method is utilized with clinical monitoring, but seizures can be detected only while patients are admitted and while testing occurs. Since clinical monitoring is not an everyday activity, a great number of seizures goes unnoticed. Advancements in biosensors and machine learning principles allow us the opportunity to design an affordable mobile device, which would be used daily to monitor and register epileptic seizures. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Biosensors; Epilepsy; Machine learning; Seizure,Conference Paper,Scopus

Simulation modeling gives highly appreciable solutions by providing a clear picture of complex systems. The reason for the same is that nonlinear structure of real-world problems with complexities cannot be handled by linearized models. Further, computational complexities of large-scale dynamical system simulations occurring in such situations will be reduced by model order reduction (MOR). This is further improved with the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this paper, the generalized neural network modeling of nonlinear autonomous dissipative system using machine learning and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) has been addressed, which is a novel one. The fluid mechanical model considered here is trained with multiple temporal swatches evolved on different parametric variations and trialed out at different time instances. Machine learning tries to learn such models by analyzing snapshot observations from active systems. The neural network developed by machine learning is able to make better prediction for validating data which is different from the training data set. The complexity of the data set generated by nonlinear autonomous dissipative system is reduced by applying the POD on the original data set. This demonstrates that the neural network is successfully utilized to macromodel the autonomous dynamical system. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Autonomous system; Burgers’ equation; Dissipative systems; Finite difference method; Machine learning; Neural network,Conference Paper,Scopus

Data may be processed and stored more quickly and efficiently with the help of quantum machine learning. Using neural networks as analogies for physical systems is an important part of quantum machine learning. This paper summarizes the CIFAR-10 dataset. For the dataset, “five training batches and one testing batch” are used to divide the ten thousand photographs. One thousand images from each class are randomly selected for inclusion in the test batch. Even though each batch comprises all of the remaining photographs, some batches have a greater number of images from a particular category. It is estimated that each training batch contains around 5000 photographs. This section includes an evaluation of the classifier’s overall performance. Quantum neural networks describe “a parameterized quantum computational model best” implemented “on a quantum computer” (QNN). Third-party libraries such as PyTorch, Qiskit, and matplotlib are frequently loaded into the program. PyTorch is a popular option for GPU and CPU-based Deep Learning applications because it is built on Torch rather than merely Python.

However, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on homomorphic encryption cannot use general non-linear activation functions, Thus, the classification accuracy is low. We proposed a novel method to create an activation function that improves the classification accuracy by performing a pre-training optimization on the coefficients of the polynomial approximation of the Mish function. We confirmed the improvement of classification accuracy for MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 by optimizing the Mish function through pre-training. The classification accuracy can be improved by 4.27% for CIFAR-10. Furthermore, we showed that classification accuracy improves for Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 even when different networks and datasets are optimized by pre-training the activation function.

DTs are used to simulate physical assets and improve the efficiency and decision making of industrial production. DT models are usually fitted with data collected from their physical counterparts through sensor readings. The data quality of the information retrieved by sensors is one main problem when training and retraining DT models. Poor data quality leads to low-accuracy DT predictions. In this study, a methodology is proposed for fault detection and offset error prediction problems related to retraining the DT of two wind turbine systems. Wind turbines are of utmost importance in Industry 4.0, as the use of renewable energy reduces production cost and benefits the environment. Having time series data sets with sensor readings of two real wind turbines, machine learning techniques based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) layers were implemented for multiple sensor fault forecasting. High-precision models were obtained and experiments were designed and performed to test the effectiveness of the proposed multi-fault detection system.

Internet of Things (IoT) is now driving the industrial revolution 4.0 and hence learning remotely is inevitable. In the same vein, configurable remote laboratories are an important aspect of the electronic engineering revolution. Configurability enables laboratory platforms to run with multiple sets of hardware and to design systems capable of handling future developments and plugins, bringing more support to students performing laboratory work during the Covid-19 era. This is a study to develop a relatively inexpensive, configurable, and cloud-based remote laboratory platform for electronic engineering students. The laboratory platform provides real-time interaction with two myRIO devices. The devices are used as the instructor’s hardware experimental setup and are in the faculty laboratory and functioning as IoT nodes. LabVIEW myRIO toolkit was used to design the finite state machines which contain the lab applications. Each device consists of a tri-state finite state machine with each state being a laboratory session.

Before the classification process, bioinformatics analysis was performed using the QIIME2–2021.4 tool which resulted in profiling microbiome communities present in host organisms. Alpha diversity metrics were calculated using three different indexes (Shannon’s diversity index, Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity, and Observed OTUs) while Kruskal–Wallis test was used to confirm significant difference (p-value &lt; 0.05) between study groups. To achieve binary classification, the dataset was divided into three subsets each containing two groups (AD vs aMCI, AD vs HC, aMCI vs HC) Prior to the classification process, SelectKBest with the f_classif algorithm was used as univariate feature selection to reduce the number of features in each group to top five. 5-fold cross-validation yielded high accuracy results (going over 70%) for a number of classifiers, with the highest accuracy reach of 78.3% (via Logistic Regression) in the case of distinguishing between aMCI and HC subjects.

Multi-spectral imaging (MSI) is today a commonplace tool in the diagnosis of painted artworks. Instrumentation is becoming more accessible with a wide variety of custom and commercial equipment available. Obtained spectral data can be interpreted to provide information about pigments, painting practice, conservation history and condition of painted art works. Such data is typically analysed by the expert user (a scientist) and helps the way practitioners (conservators) visualise details presented by each unique artwork. Artificial intelligence (AI) is now being applied to the field of MSI. Machine learning enables the efficient comparison of spectral responses to pre-existing databases, providing automated interpretation of results. Clear mappings of selected pigments, damage patterns or condition phenomenon provide the conservator with a new means to visualise, diagnose and monitor artworks. An innovative technological system, provided by XpectralTEK (Portugal), was trialled at SRAL (Maastricht) in the spring of 2021. Multispectral images (360–1200 nm) were captured using the unique camera and acquisition platform. AI learning created overlays and mappings empowering the conservators by providing material-technical insights. This paper will report on case studies highlighting the functionality of the XpectralTEK’s system.

Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Deep Belief Network (DBN) were used, to maintain, update and regulate the states of the network model. The incorporation of RBM on DBN was done using artificial features obtained at the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) stage. This research produced a deep learning hybrid approach to optimize QoS and QoE in multimedia applications. A novel predictive QoE model where relevant QoS parameters and how they influence QoE was also presented, and finally a rich QoS-QoE dataset was presented, which can further be used as a framework to ensure responsible AI in multimedia systems. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Deep learning; Multimedia; QoS/QoE,Conference Paper,Scopus

To increase the efficiency of post-harvest industrial processes, there is a need to introduce technologies for classifying different species of pistachio. This study considers an automated model to separate pistachio species. The proposed pistachio species classification consists of three main phases; features selection based on slime mould algorithm phase, feature interpretation based on explainable artificial intelligence phase, and finally classification of pistachio species using logistic regression phase.

Correct and early prediction of disease is very much important for the treatment of curing the disease. Women identified at the stage of benign have high chances of getting curable but identifying at the stage of malignant is regarded as a dangerous state of cancer. Many machine learning algorithms are used for the diagnosis of breast cancer effectively. In this article, eight classification models such as Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighborhood (K-NN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Gaussian Naïve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and AdaBoost classifier are used for predicting two classes, i.e., benign and malignant. To choose the best fit classification model for prediction, a confusion matrix is used to evaluate the performance of each model. Also, parameters such as accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F-measure, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) are discussed for each model.

Parkinson’s disease generally refers to a neurological and neurodegenerative movement disorder, which affects millions of people all over the world. Loss of automatic movements and rigidity of muscles are common symptoms, which eventually lead to difficulty in walking, balancing, and coordination disorders. Over time, these symptoms deteriorate the patient’s physical, emotional, and mental health. There is currently no way to completely cure the Parkinson’s disease. However, a therapeutic care can be provided to reduce the prognosis of the disease before the patient’s condition deteriorates. This necessitates the need to implement machine learning approaches for Parkinson’s disease detection. The proposed machine learning algorithm will be trained by utilizing the audio recordings the patient’s speaking abilities. Following the training process, introducing further input signal will tend to identify and confirm the existence of Parkinson’s disease by allowing the medical practitioners to take appropriate action and adopt different medical technologies and approaches to avoid and, more significantly, prevent the patient from becoming further affected. Further, the algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest will be examined to investigate and analyze different properties and determine the appropriate algorithm that may give superior accuracy in the early identification and confirmation of Parkinson’s disease. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",K-Nearest Neighbors; Logistic Regression; Naive Bayes; Parkinson’s disease; Random Forest; Vocal skills,Conference Paper,Scopus

Due to high rotating speed and tremendous momentum of the rotor, the centrifugal force may lead to flying apart of the rotor parts, which brings a great threat to the operation safety. Early detection and prediction of potential failures could prevent catastrophic plant downtime and economic loss. In this paper, we divide the operational states of a rotating machine into normal, risky, and high-risk ones based on the time to the moment of failure. Then, a cascade classification algorithm is proposed to predict the states in two steps; first, we determine whether the machine is in normal or abnormal condition; for time periods predicted as abnormal, we further classify them into risky or high-risk state. Moreover, traditional classification model evaluation metrics, such as confusion matrix and true-false accuracy, are static and neglect online prediction dynamics and uneven error-prediction prices. An online prediction ability index is proposed to select prediction models with consistent online predictions and smaller close-to-downtime prediction errors.

Keeping the food from spoiling bits helps keep food from spoiling and reduces incidental losses in the business. An Internet of Things (IoT)-based framework for food monitoring is proposed in this paper to protect food from spoilage caused by changes in environmental conditions during storage. In the current scenario, the prediction was made using recorded sensed data, and a detailed analysis was performed to identify the factors causing the food to spoil. This chapter proposes an automated controlling mechanism for environmental parameters using Adaptive Random Forest prediction and IoT. Environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, moisture, light, and so on, which affect the nutritional value of food, are considered in the proposed work. All sensed data would be stored on the cloud, and analysis will be performed to predict the environmental condition at the storage location to avoid food spoilage by changing to the appropriate environmental condition.

Chlorophyll ? can be used as a eutrophication indicator, which is especially essential in a rich yet vulnerable ecosystem like the study area. Bayesian regularized artificial neural networks and Long Short-term Memory Neural Networks (LSTMs) employing a rolling window approach were used as forecasting algorithms with a one-week prediction horizon. Two input strategies were tested: using data from the own time series or including exogenous variables among the inputs. In this second case, mutual information and the Minimum-Redundancy-Maximum-Relevance approach were utilized to select the most relevant variables. The models obtained reasonable results for the univariate input scheme with ?¯ values over 0.75 in levels between 0.5 and 2 m. The inclusion of exogenous variables increased these values to above 0.85 for the same depth levels. The models and methodologies presented in this paper can constitute a very useful tool to help predict eutrophication episodes and act as decision-making tools that allow the governmental and environmental agencies to prevent the degradation of El Mar Menor. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Artificial neural networks; Bayesian regularization; Chlorophyll; Deep learning; Eutrophication; LSTM; Machine learning; Mar Menor,Conference Paper,Scopus

Because of its simplicity, contemporary gradient-based algorithms such as momentum Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) are commonly employed in Deep Neural Networks (DNN). However, the process of convergence is slowed by the choice of an appropriate learning rate and the local minima problem. To address these issues, this research proposes a unique approach for training DNNs called Simulated Annealing Based Gradient Descent (SAGD), which involves optimizing weights and biases. The SAGD technique optimizes the function by combining gradient information with the simulated annealing notion. The learning rate does not need to be manually adjusted with this method. Instead, using the simulated annealing approach, the learning rate is modified automatically for each epoch. The approach is tested utilizing VGG16, ResNet 18 and InceptionV3 architectures on typical multi-class classification data sets such as Iris, MNIST, and CIFAR10. The performance of SAGD and other state-of-the-art gradient descent optimization methods is compared, and it is demonstrated that SAGD performs comparably to existing gradient descent methods. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Classification; DNN; Gradient descent; Optimization; Simulated annealing,Conference Paper,Scopus

Four out of every five CVD deaths are caused by coronary illnesses and strokes, with 33% of these deaths happening unexpectedly in adults under the age of 70. CVDs are known to cause cardiovascular breakdown, and this dataset comprises 12 elements that can be used to predict a probable coronary sickness. People who have cardiovascular disease or are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of at least one risk factor such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or a pre-existing illness) require early identification and treatment, which an AI model may give.

Heart illnesses account for one- third of all deaths worldwide. Heart disease accounts for half of all deaths in the United States and other industrialized countries. Every year, almost 17 million people die from cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and the condition is particularly widespread in Asia.

We are comparing their performance and then will suggest which algorithm is going to be model for this specific task. We are going to doing lots of task feature selection, model evaluation and will building another next set of model based on selected model and then we will decide which machine learning model is more generalize.

In order to diagnose these disorders, patients are often required to go through a series of diagnostic tests that demand concentration for accurate results. This paper aims to lower misdiagnoses that result from the lack of concentration in patients by developing an algorithm that recognizes mental states using 989 columns of EEG brain wave data. These data columns were entered into a train split function and analyzed using different classification models of Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Adaptive Boosting, K-neighbors, LGBM, and XGB. The control experiment analyzed the raw dataset, the second and third experiments utilized feature extraction algorithms of PCA and ICA analysis respectively, and the fourth experiment used correlation matrix analysis to produce accuracy scores. The highest accuracy score of 98.19% was produced by the LGBM Classifier in the control experiment and the most efficient feature selection method was PCA. The highest PCA processed data yielded an accuracy score of 87.7% using the random forest classification model while the correlation matrix analysis yielded an accuracy score of 80.04% using the LGBM classifier. These findings will allow psychologists and psychiatrists to provide methods to help patients answer all questions at a sustained level of sufficient concentration, ultimately allowing a higher percentage of proper diagnoses to be made. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Concentration; Diagnosis; EEG; Machine learning; Mental state,Conference Paper,Scopus

The competitor to boxing has recently risen in the form of mixed martial arts (MMA), which is becoming quite a famous sport, most notably recognized due to the Ultimate Fighting Championship promotion (UFC). As with most other competitive sports, it is never obvious who will emerge as the winner of a specific MMA bout, as the sport is very unpredictable by nature. This paper focuses on using machine learning (ML) algorithms and classifiers to predict the winners of MMA bouts in the Ultimate Fighting Championship promotion. The data used to train and test the algorithms and classifiers is sampled from the rich UFC database which includes details from all bouts that have taken place in the UFC throughout the history of the promotion. The predictions are obtained without using any data that can directly indicate the winner of a bout. The results are presented through accuracy percentages for two different types of sample sets. Successful bout prediction percentages range from 80% to just over 92% across all subsets. This model can be further expanded and modified to predict the winner for future matchups in the promotion. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Bout prediction; Machine learning (ML); Mixed martial arts (MMA); Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC),Conference Paper,Scopus

This scheme aims to attain optimized solutions by maximizing the accuracy of the model and minimizing the functions like the computational burden. Mathematical-informed frameworks are to be employed to enable reliable, accurate, and robust understanding of various complex biological processes that involve a variety of spatial and temporal scales. This complexity requires a holistic understanding of different biological processes through multi-stage integrative models that are capable of capturing the significant attributes on the related scales. Fractional-order differential and integral equations can provide the generalization of traditional integral and differential equations through the extension of the conceptions with respect to biological processes. In addition, algorithmic complexity (computational complexity), as a way of comparing the efficiency of an algorithm, can enable a better grasping and designing of efficient algorithms in computational biology as well as other related areas of science. It also enables the classification of the computational problems based on their algorithmic complexity, as defined according to the way the resources are required for the solution of the problem, including the execution time and scale with the problem size. Based on a novel mathematical informed framework and multi-staged integrative method concerning algorithmic complexity, this study aims at establishing a robust and accurate model reliant on the combination of fractional-order derivative and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for the diagnostic and differentiability predictive purposes for the disease, (diabetes, as a metabolic disorder, in our case) which may display various and transient biological properties. Another aim of this study is benefitting from the concept of algorithmic complexity to obtain the fractional-order derivative with the least complexity in order that it would be possible to achieve the optimized solution. To this end, the following steps were applied and integrated. Firstly, the Caputo fractional-order derivative with three-parametric Mittag-Leffler function (?,?,?) was applied to the diabetes dataset. Thus, new fractional models with varying degrees were established by ensuring data fitting through the fitting algorithm Mittag-Leffler function with three parameters (?,?,?) based on heavy-tailed distributions. Following this application, the new dataset, named the mfc_diabetes, was obtained. Secondly, classical derivative (calculus) was applied to the diabetes dataset, which yielded the cd_diabetes dataset. Subsequently, the performance of the new dataset as obtained from the first step and of the dataset obtained from the second step as well as of the diabetes dataset was compared through the application of the feed forward back propagation (FFBP) algorithm, which is one of the ANN algorithms. Next, the fractional order derivative model which would be the most optimal for the disease was generated. Finally, algorithmic complexity was employed to attain the Caputo fractional-order derivative with the least complexity, or to achieve the optimized solution. This approach through the application of fractional-order calculus to optimization methods and the experimental results have revealed the advantage of maximizing the model’s accuracy and minimizing the cost functions like the computational costs, which points to the applicability of the method proposed in different domains characterized by complex, dynamic and transient components. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Caputo fractional-order derivative; Classical derivatives; Complex systems; Computational and nonlinear dynamics; Computational complexity; Data analysis; Data fitting; Data-driven fractional biological modeling; Dynamic biological models; Fractional calculus and complexity; Fractional-order derivatives; Integer-order derivatives; Mathematical biology; Mittag-Leffler functions; Multilayer perceptron algorithm; Neural networks; Nonlinearity; Uncertainty,Conference Paper,Scopus

If the result concludes that Only Gene or Only Mutation has a stronger effect on tumors, then it weighs nature more in this debate. Likewise, if Only Others is the dominant factor, then this emphasizes the nurture more in this debate. Gathered data was processed and went through eight different machine learning algorithms to predict the tumor size and stage. The ‘Others’ was concluded as the most influential factor for the tumor. Among the ‘Others’, the type of breast surgery and the number of chemotherapy received were identified with the highest correlation with tumor size and stage.

In today's pandemic situation, due to working from home, employees are working for long hours, and spending long hours is a pretty challenging task. Nowadays, irrespective of age concerns, sciatica, Kyphosis, and lordosis are becoming a significant problem even for youngsters. The longest nerve in our body is sciatica, which causes severe pain due to stress applied while sitting in the wrong posture. It gets compressed with our lower back discs, which may lead to severe radiating pain from our lower back disc to the entire right leg, and a person can't even perform his daily activities comfortably. To prevent these problems, sitting posture while working should be maintained correctly. This work mainly focuses on preventing employers, and students from sciatica, Kyphosis, and Lordosis health issues. We used all kinds of sitting postures that interact while working with a laptop, classified which posture was good, and predicted which stance led to health issues. We used Convolutional Neural Network and K-Nearest Neighbor machine learning algorithms to predict the correct sitting postures. In KNN, we followed two techniques to improve the performance: using Edge detection. The other method we used was detecting facial landmark detection and plotting their respective rotational angles. So by using this technique, we improved the accuracy and precision rate compared to the classical Edge detection. We also trained the model with CNN, which gives good results.

This is particularly true in sub-Saharan Africa where environmental and hydro-meteorological hazards are recurrent. Microwave links have been proposed as an alternative or an additional source of measurement to the traditional rainfall measurement instruments. However, the estimation of rainfall based on microwave links relies on some assumptions and approximations which induce considerable differences between resulting rainfall estimations and ground observations. One of the major sources of errors in the process of estimating rainfall from microwave links is the determination of the adequate drop size distribution. Deep learning models have been recently proposed with satisfaction to improve rainfall estimates from microwave links of mobile telecommunication networks. But these models were built based on experimental setups and require large datasets. Moreover, base transceiver stations of mobile telecommunication networks operate with different signals resolutions, and a poor signal resolution increases the difficulty for data-driven approaches. In this paper, we propose to use machine learning techniques for rainfall estimation from microwave links based on existing infrastructures, in the context of information and technical restrictions from the mobile telecommunication network. Observations collected from four microwave links and two weather radars in the Netherlands (Western Europe) are used to build regression models for rainfall estimation using path integrated attenuations from these links, and received signals levels as explanatory variables. The results are satisfactory as the values of the coefficient of determination and the correlation coefficient between predictions and observations are up to 0.92 and 0.96, respectively. This proves that simple machine learning regressors can be successfully used to estimate rainfall using microwave links of mobile telecommunication networks, and they clearly outperform the empirical computational methods in the literature. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Ensemble learning; Machine learning algorithm; Machine learning regression; Microwave signal attenuation; Rainfall estimation,Article,Scopus

In this study, a periodic water quality monitoring was conducted in the rivers and streams of a tropical island (Ishigaki Island, Japan) to identify the factors controlling the concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), total phosphorus (TP) and dissolved silicon (DSi) with a special focus on the catchment characteristics (e.g., land use, surface geology, topography). Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm was employed to develop predictive models for nutrient concentrations from the catchment properties. The developed models could predict nutrient concentrations with sufficient accuracy, demonstrating that the studied nutrients are strongly affected by catchment properties. Agricultural land uses (e.g., livestock barn, sugarcane field) were ranked as the most important parameters for DIN and TP, while broadleaf forest was the most influential factor for DSi. Using the RF models, the contributions of DIN originating from sugarcane fields (i.e., fertilizers) and barns (i.e., manure) to riverine DIN were estimated, which were up to 60% in total in the studied river basins. Furthermore, the yield of DIN from sugarcane fields, calculated as the concentration of DIN derived from sugarcane fields divided by the percent area of sugarcane fields, strongly positively correlated with the areal coverage of limestone, suggesting that fertilizer-derived DIN is more prone to leaching out from cropland soil to groundwater and rivers in catchments with a higher dominance of calcareous geology.

Model parameter uncertainty is automatically quantified, enabling probabilistic predictions with each equation produced by the GPSR algorithm. Model evidence is also quantified in this process, and its use is shown to increase interpretability, improve robustness to noise, and reduce overfitting when compared to a conventional GPSR implementation on both numerical and physical experiments. © 2022",Bayesian model selection; Fractional Bayes factor; Interpretable machine learning; Symbolic regression,Article,Scopus

For this purpose, we used machine and deep learning techniques, i.e., one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1D CNN), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), respectively. We also used bagging-based three regressors, i.e., 1D CNN, MLP, and kNN, to predict the network load. In addition, we addressed both anomaly detection and load prediction because the presence of anomalies results in high load. The accurate detection of anomalies will result in less network load. Thus, anomalies like a sudden increase in network traffic from a certain cell are also added based on the network traffic pattern to make the dataset more realistic. The simulation results showed that the bagging-based EL outperformed the existing techniques in predicting network load. Moreover, the voting technique outperforms in the case of anomaly detection. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",5G cellular networks; Anomaly detection; Data analytics; Deep learning; Machine learning,Article,Scopus

Integrating machine learning into designing IoT-based cyber–physical systems is essential. However, it is considered a challenging problem. This stems from the fact that IoT devices generate extensive data that requires extensive processing to achieve adequate learning. Relying on local learning by each IoT device is not feasible in most cases due to its limited resources. On the contrary, relying on all cloud-based learning requires transmitting a large amount of data to the cloud to perform the learning process, which is inefficient in large-scale IoT deployments. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel edge-computing architecture that employs the concept of distributed multi-task learning over EC networks in large-scale IoT-based cyber–physical systems. The architecture develops multiple distributed learning algorithms, a data placement architecture, task allocation algorithms, and a network protocol. In addition, it considers the problem of learning model parameters from IoT data distributed over different edge nodes in a large geographical area without sending raw data to the cloud. The architecture supports several distributed machine models that are trained using a combination of machine learning algorithms and population-based search algorithms to optimize the learning process. Population-based search algorithms allow for maintaining a set of candidate solutions, with each solution corresponding to a unique point in the search space for an optimal solution. Having the dataset distributed over several edge nodes, with each node having its own unique set of candidate solutions, increases the chance of finding a solution that generalizes well for the overall dataset combined. Simulation experiments with real IoT datasets are conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed learning models. Results show the ability to achieve high-accuracy results that are close to single-machine models but with significantly efficient edge computing resource utilization. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Artificial Intelligence (AI); Big-Data; Cyber–physical systems (CPSs); Distributed learning; Edge-computing; Internet-of-Things (IoT),Article,Scopus

The cavity was under a magnetic field. The entropy production (ENP), Nusselt (Nu) number, and Bejan (Be) number were studied at Hartmann (Ha) numbers of 0–100, Richardson (Ri) numbers of 0.01–100, and Rayleigh (Ra) numbers of 103-106. Also, optimization was carried out to maximize the Nu and minimize the ENP and Be in the aforementioned ranges. The simulations were performed using the SIMPLE algorithm and finite volume method (FVM). Moreover, a staggered grid was employed for the simulation. It was found that a rise in the Ha increased the Nu and reduced the ENP. An increase in the Ri diminished the ENP and Nu and raised the Be. The Nu and ENP increased as the Ra increased, while the Be declined.

Now, computer science offers a universal solution: Neural Networks. Neural Networks are powerful function approximators that can learn constitutive relations from large data without any knowledge of the underlying physics. However, classical Neural Networks entirely ignore a century of research in constitutive modeling, violate thermodynamic considerations, and fail to predict the behavior outside the training regime. Here we design a new family of Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks that inherently satisfy common kinematical, thermodynamical, and physical constraints and, at the same time, constrain the design space of admissible functions to create robust approximators, even in the presence of sparse data. Towards this goal we revisit the non-linear field theories of mechanics and reverse-engineer the network input to account for material objectivity, material symmetry and incompressibility; the network output to enforce thermodynamic consistency; the activation functions to implement physically reasonable restrictions; and the network architecture to ensure polyconvexity. We demonstrate that this new class of models is a generalization of the classical neo Hooke, Blatz Ko, Mooney Rivlin, Yeoh, and Demiray models and that the network weights have a clear physical interpretation in the form of shear moduli, stiffness-like parameters, and exponential coefficients. When trained with classical benchmark data for rubber under uniaxial tension, biaxial extension, and pure shear, our network autonomously selects the best constitutive model and learns its set of parameters. Our findings suggest that Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks have the potential to induce a paradigm shift in constitutive modeling, from user-defined model selection to automated model discovery.

Existing machine learning methods have been widely used to predict the population using regular grids. However, regular grids defined as basic units lack semantic information, and error autocorrelation may be ignored when using machine learning methods. As a result, the prediction accuracy may be impacted. Therefore, a two-level random forest method is proposed in this research based on error compensation to predict the population distribution of urban functional zones. The first-level random forest model is used to model the census variable and the covariables, and the second-level model is further applied to address the error term. By using this two-level model, population distribution can be predicted in urban functional zones identified based on an area-weighted POI proportion. Experimental results from Changsha, China, show that the determination coefficients and root mean square error of the proposed method are 0.90 and 7,436, respectively. These results are better than those from comparative methods, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method. A population density of 203 single and 387 mixed functional zones is finally obtained, which can provide useful urban management and planning information. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Areal interpolation; Error compensation; Random Forest; Urban functional zones; Urban population,Article,Scopus

Several studies investigated the inclusion of top-down feedback connections in convolutional networks; however, it remains unclear how and when these connections are functionally helpful. Here we address this question in the context of object recognition under noisy conditions. We consider deep convolutional networks (CNNs) as models of feed-forward visual processing and implement Predictive Coding (PC) dynamics through feedback connections (predictive feedback) trained for reconstruction or classification of clean images. First, we show that the accuracy of the network implementing PC dynamics is significantly larger compared to its equivalent forward network. Importantly, to directly assess the computational role of predictive feedback in various experimental situations, we optimize and interpret the hyper-parameters controlling the network's recurrent dynamics. That is, we let the optimization process determine whether top-down connections and predictive coding dynamics are functionally beneficial. Across different model depths and architectures (3-layer CNN, ResNet18, and EfficientNetB0) and against various types of noise (CIFAR100-C), we find that the network increasingly relies on top-down predictions as the noise level increases; in deeper networks, this effect is most prominent at lower layers. All in all, our results provide novel insights relevant to Neuroscience by confirming the computational role of feedback connections in sensory systems, and to Machine Learning by revealing how these can improve the robustness of current vision models. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Corruption robustness; Deep learning; Feedback; Predictive coding,Article,Scopus

This study used SDMs to predict four dominant tree species distributions in northern Iran temperate forests (400km2 area) using high-resolution Sentinel-2 data (20 m) and topographic variables. We divided the explanatory variables into four datasets with increasing complexity of Sentinel-2 data and modelled distributions using four statistical and machine learning algorithms: random forest (RF), generalized boosting model (GBM), generalized linear model (GLM), and generalized additive model (GAM). Our results suggested differences in the predictive performance of the four algorithms. We found the most complex dataset, including topographic variables, Sentinel-2 bands, and vegetation and soil indices, gave the best fit for the four tree species, improving the accuracy of models for the different species between 5 and 16%. We then selected the most complex dataset to produce an ensemble model of the modeling algorithms where evaluation criteria were varied for tree species. Our result showed that the performance of SDMs improved using different satellite remote sensing data including raw bands, topographic variables and indices in the Hyrcanian forest, northern Iran. Elevation was a more significant variable than Sentinel bands and Sentinel vegetation indices variables for predicting the tree species distributions. With the Hyrcanian Forest included in this study region of northern Iran recently declared a UNESCO World Heritage site, a key result of our improved species distribution maps for these four dominant tree species is to support conservation management of forest biodiversity in this region. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Forest farming; Forest management; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Species distribution models,Article,Scopus

Our study aimed to develop an early diagnosis model and rupture classification model by analyzing plasma metabolic profiles of IA patients. Materials and methods: Plasma samples from a cohort of 105 participants, including 75 IA patients in unruptured and ruptured status (UIA, RIA) and 30 control participants were collected for comprehensive metabolic evaluation using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry-based pseudotargeted metabolomics method. Furthermore, an integrated machine learning strategy based on LASSO, random forest and logistic regression were used for feature selection and model construction. Results: The metabolic profiling disturbed significantly in UIA and RIA patients. Notably, adenosine content was significantly downregulated in UIA, and various glycine-conjugated secondary bile acids were decreased in RIA patients. Enriched KEGG pathways included glutathione metabolism and bile acid metabolism. Two sets of biomarker panels were defined to discriminate IA and its rupture with the area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.843 and 0.929 on the validation sets, respectively. Conclusions: The present study could contribute to a better understanding of IA etiopathogenesis and facilitate discovery of new therapeutic targets.

It has been observed that the performance of vision-based inspection approaches degrades considerably upon utilizing images captured under shop-floor conditions. This work proposes utilizing Histogram Equalization and adversarial training through Neural Structure Learning (NSL) for developing a robust vision-based Surface Defect Classification framework. A novel deep neural network architecture obtains adversarial samples in the extracted feature space instead of obtaining the same in the original input image space. The architecture can be easily integrated and employed with various machine learning models. A commonly employed steel surface defect dataset (NEU) with practical relevance to industrial cases is selected for the model training and experimental studies. The robustness of the proposed approach is evaluated over the Extended Diversity Enhanced (ENEU) dataset derived by simulating image acquisition variations similar to shop floor conditions. The results reveal that the proposed approach enhances the recognition accuracy of the baseline method from 87.7% to 92.4% over ENEU. The prediction accuracy of the proposed approach is considerably better than the traditional methods and deep learning competitors over ENEU. The qualitative and quantitative comparison of results obtained using the present approach with methods reported in the literature demonstrates the effectiveness of adversarial training in improving the generalization abilities of machine learning models. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd,Adversarial training; Computer vision; Defect detection; Histogram Equalization; Steel surface,Article,Scopus

The present study introduces a computational model for predicting the maximum fiber pull-out force and corresponding bond slip. An extensive literature survey was performed to create a pertinent comprehensive experimental database. A total of 382 experimental data were utilized to develop and train the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models. The model input parameters included the fiber embedded length, fiber inclination angle, fiber tensile strength, fiber length-to-diameter ratio, loading rate, water-to-cement ratio, concrete compressive strength, and fiber geometry. The model output consisted of the maximum pull-out force and corresponding slip. The results indicate that ANN with two hidden layers and 12 neurons was adequate for predicting the outputs with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of less than 10%. To obtain the importance of the inputs on the outputs (the maximum fiber pull-out force and the corresponding slip), a sensitivity analysis was done based on the Milne formula on the proposed ANN. According to the results, it was found that among the eight inputs, the parameters of the geometric shape of the fibers (straight, hooked-end and spiral fibers) and fiber tensile strength have the highest effect on the outputs, with an impact percentage of 16.1 and 15.1, respectively. The mean square error (MSE) was 0.9 for the maximum pull-out force and 0.14 for slip, respectively.

Existing mesh generation methods suffer from high computational complexity, low mesh quality in complex geometries, and speed limitations. These methods and tools, including commercial software packages, are typically semiautomatic and they need inputs or help from human experts. By formulating the mesh generation as a Markov decision process (MDP) problem, we are able to use a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm called “soft actor-critic” to automatically learn from trials the policy of actions for mesh generation. The implementation of this RL algorithm for mesh generation allows us to build a fully automatic mesh generation system without human intervention and any extra clean-up operations, which fills the gap in the existing mesh generation tools.

As the emerging device appears and technology advances, it consists of highly-correlated multivariate parameters and has a non-linear relationship. Moreover, technology development requires extensive cost and effort, and often it takes several years to establish a physical model after the advent of new technology. Thus, this paper presents an effective data-driven multi-objective optimization with neural network-based sensitivity analysis for semiconductor devices before explicitly developing a physical or compact model. Sensitivity analysis allows a quick search for influential parameters and selects design parameter candidates for a customized solution. Then, the selected parameters are adjusted to maintain within the set range by the scaled sensitivities and to have robustness against noise. It optimizes design variables to meet performance and variation requirements simultaneously, considering correlation between parameters. Therefore, multi-objective solutions hold physical consistency and are found with ¡ 1.7% error. The proposed method is efficient in computational time, which is significantly reduced by more than 80% compared to Bayesian optimization for process optimization. This approach is a general methodology applicable to various industries besides the semiconductor field.

It is notable that the diversified characteristics of residential consumers, which many greatly affect its performance in demand response, have not been fully considered in existing incentive mechanisms. In this paper, an incremental incentive mechanism for incentive-based demand response (IBDR) is proposed, in which consumers obtain different incentives according to the increment of response, so that the incentive can follow the change of consumers' marginal cost. We theoretically illustrate that the proposed incremental incentive mechanism can effectively improve the profit of load service entity (LSE), as well as the benefit of highly flexible consumers, compared with other existing incentive mechanism. In practice, LSE's bidding strategy in the day ahead market is affected by the intraday IBDR strategy that cannot be known in advance. In order to solve the bidding problem with incomplete information in the day ahead market, we propose an asynchronous double-interaction deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to maximize LSE's cumulative profit of multiple time slots throughout the day. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed mechanism can improve the consumers' response depth while reducing the unit incentive cost, and the proposed DRL algorithm has relatively stable and satisfactory performance even in highly uncertain environment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Consumer surplus; Deep reinforcement learning; Incentive-based demand response; Incremental incentive mechanism,Article,Scopus

Experiments are conducted with both dogbone and notched specimens at different strain rates and temperatures. All tests are analyzed by inverse engineering to identify the strain hardening behaviour at large plastic strains up to fracture. The experimental results show the highly coupling effect of strain rate and temperature. The two hardening laws of Swift-Voce model and p-model are calibrated by the finite element model update procedure, and the combination with the smallest error is selected as the input set of the artificial neural network (ANN) model. Then the dynamic hardening behaviours are modelled by the ANN to consider the highly coupled effect. The calibrated ANN model is further applied to ABAQUS/Explicit for numerical simulation under different loading conditions. Taking the finite element calculation time and prediction accuracy into consideration, the ANN model with single hidden layer optimized by particle swarm optimization algorithm is finally selected.

This study investigates the response of MR under cyclic conditions as a function of four key parameters, i.e., the loading magnitude, the number of loading cycles, the loading frequency, and the confining pressure. To do so, two non-linear predictive models, namely, the artificial neural network (ANN), and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), are used to predict the MR values under different loading conditions. To evaluate and predict MR, an experimental database with 196 data samples is considered in this study. A series of sensitivity analyses is carried out to investigate the most effective parameters in each non-linear model and also predict the highest performance model. Although the results from the primary validation phase are satisfactory for the ANN and ANFIS models, ANFIS proves better (i.e., the coefficient of determination = 0.709) at estimating the MR during the secondary validation phase, using an independent dataset. Hence, it can be used as a powerful and practical model for predicting the magnitude of MR. On the basis of the ANFIS model, this study also offers some design considerations in terms of MR of ballast under a practical range of cyclic loading parameters. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Ballast; Cyclic loading; Machine learning; Predictive models; Resilient modulus,Article,Scopus

The main objectives of this study were to: (1) evaluate the suitability and robustness of different vegetation indices for LAI estimation of different crops; (2) compare the performance of crop-specific and generic algorithms; (3) evaluate the performance of statistical regression, machine learning regression, and the PROSAIL-D with different inversion strategies. Results showed that: (1) the simple ratio index (SR) performed best for cotton and winter wheat, the MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI) performed best for maize; (2) the models trained over specific crop types performed better than those trained over all crop types together; (3) for crop-specific models, artificial neural networks (ANN) performed better than support vector machine regression (SVR), partial least square regression (PLSR), and statistical regression methods, while the PROSAIL-D yielded similar or slightly better performance as compared with ANN method. Furthermore, the look-up table (LUT) strategy performed better than iterative optimization strategy (Shuffled Complex Evolution method developed at the University of Arizona, SCE-UA). Results indicated that there was not an optimal model that could be used to precisely estimate LAI of different crops since the relationship between the specific hyperspectral reflectance and the LAI of different crops were different.

However, most of them focus on global distribution alignment, ignoring the fine-grained domain discrepancy. Besides, they generally require auxiliary models, bringing extra computation costs. To tackle these issues, this study proposes an UDA method that differentiates individual samples without the help of extra models. To this end, we introduce a novel discrepancy metric, termed style discrepancy, to distinguish different target samples. We also propose a paradigm for adversarial style discrepancy minimization (ASDM). Specifically, we fix the parameters of the feature extractor and maximize style discrepancy to update the classifier, which helps detect more hard samples. Adversely, we fix the parameters of the classifier and minimize the style discrepancy to update the feature extractor, pushing those hard samples near the support of the source distribution. Such adversary helps to progressively detect and adapt more hard samples, leading to fine-grained domain adaptation. Experiments on different UDA tasks validate the effectiveness of ASDM. Overall, without any extra models, ASDM reaches a 46.9% mIoU in the GTA5 to Cityscapes benchmark and an 84.7% accuracy in the VisDA-2017 benchmark, outperforming many existing adversarial-learning-based methods. © 2022 The Author(s)",Domain adaptation; Transfer learning,Article,Scopus

However, traditional models cannot fully consider the complex nonlinear relationship between NH3–N and various relative environmental parameters. The long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network can overcome this limitation. A new hybrid model BC-MODWT-DA-LSTM was proposed based on LSTM combining with the dual-stage attention (DA) mechanism and boundary corrected maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (BC-MODWT) data decomposition method. By introducing attention mechanism, LSTM could selectively focus on the input data. BC-MODWT could decompose the input data into sublayers to determine the main swings and trends of the input feature series. The BC-MODWT-DA-LSTM hybrid model was superior to other studied models with lower average prediction errors. It could maintain NASH Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) values above 0.900 under the lead time up to 7 days, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve could reach 0.992. The hybrid model also had higher prediction accuracies at the peak spots, indicating that it was capable of early warning when sudden high NH3–N pollution occurred. The high forecasting accuracy of the suggested hybrid method proved that further improving LSTM model without introducing more complex topologies was a promising water quality prediction method. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Ammonia nitrogen; Dual-stage attention mechanism; Hybrid model; Long short-term memory; Water quality modeling,Article,Scopus

While recent exposure can be assessed by measuring blood lead (half-life 30 days), chronic exposures can be assessed by measuring lead in bone (half-life of many years to decades). Bone lead measurements, in turn, have been measured non-invasively in large population-based studies using x-ray fluorescence techniques, but the method remains limited due to technical availability, expense, and the need for licensing radioactive materials used by the instruments. Thus, we developed prediction models for bone lead concentrations using a flexible machine learning approach–Super Learner, which combines the predictions from a set of machine learning algorithms for better prediction performance. The study population included 695 men in the Normative Aging Study, aged 48 years and older, whose bone (patella and tibia) lead concentrations were directly measured using K-shell-X-ray fluorescence. Ten predictors (blood lead, age, education, job type, weight, height, body mass index, waist circumference, cumulative cigarette smoking (pack-year), and smoking status) were selected for patella lead and 11 (the same 10 predictors plus serum phosphorus) for tibia lead using the Boruta algorithm. We implemented Super Learner to predict bone lead concentrations by calculating a weighted combination of predictions from 8 algorithms. In the nested cross-validation, the correlation coefficients between measured and predicted bone lead concentrations were 0.58 for patella lead and 0.52 for tibia lead, which has improved the correlations obtained in previously-published linear regression-based prediction models. We evaluated the applicability of these prediction models to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for the associations between predicted bone lead concentrations and blood pressure, and positive associations were observed. These bone lead prediction models provide reasonable accuracy and can be used to evaluate health effects of cumulative lead exposure in studies where bone lead is not measured. © 2022 The Authors",Blood lead; Patella lead; Super learner; Tibia lead,Article,Scopus

Even though kernel ridge regression (KRR) shows high generalization ability at a considerably quicker learning speed than conventional machine learning algorithms, it fails to achieve an excellent result for CIL problems. To address this inherent limitation of KRR, a novel affinity-based fuzzy KRR (AFKRR) is proposed for dealing with the binary CIL problem. In AFKRR, an affinity-based fuzzy membership value is linked to each training sample. The affinity of the majority class datapoint is measured using the support vector data description (SVDD) trained by the majority class datapoints. The classification ability of the proposed AFKRR is calculated using the area under the receiver optimal characteristics curve (AUC), F-measure and Geometric mean. AFKRR's performance is compared with the support vector machine (SVM), affinity and class probability-based fuzzy SVM (ACFSVM), entropy-based fuzzy SVM (EFSVM), improved density weighted least squares SVM (IDLSSVM-CIL), KRR and intuitionistic fuzzy KRR (IFKRR) models on a few real-world as well as a few artificial imbalanced datasets.

Given the complexities and uncertainties associated with identifying the growth mechanism of microorganism, developing an approach to estimate bacterial concentration versus different factors viz. Salinity, temperature and time is still deemed a challenge. Hence, in this study, seven different machine learning methods namely Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, K-nearest Neighbors, Ensemble Learning, Random Forest and Adaptive Boosting are utilized to predict bacterial cell concentration. A databank including 110 data points of bacterial cell concentration entailing the incubation time, salinity, temperature and yeast extract has been collected and used for preparation of these models. Graphical and statistical comparisons are used to analyze the performance and accuracy of each integrated model. The retrieved results revealed that the trained ensemble learning model is the most accurate method in estimating the bacterial growth with correlation coefficient and mean squared error of 0.9163 and 0.0542 on the tested dataset, respectively. Moreover, the KNN model with correlation coefficient and mean squared error of 0.6111 and 0.1192, respectively, is the worst model among the seven estimators. This model has great accuracy in training phase while it is not accurate in validation and testing phase. Due to this fact, it can be concluded that KNN model suffers from overfitting problem. In addition, the impacts of incubation time, yeast extract, temperature and salinity on bacterial cell concentration are also ascertained using sensitivity analysis. It is discerned that the temperature and yeast extract are the most and least effective factors on growth of microorganism, respectively. © 2022",Bacterial concentration; Growth; Machine learning; Microbial enhanced oil recovery; Microorganism,Article,Scopus

The current intelligent compaction technology allows the determination of the uniformity level of compaction over large areas according to the dynamic response of the roller. However, accurate real-time determination of the soil modulus during compaction based on roller acceleration has been challenging due to the multi-layered composite nature of the soil and the nonlinearities of the governing dynamic equations of motion and soil response. This study adopts a double-layered soil profile, and a three-dimensional finite element model, accounting for soil-drum interaction, is utilised for the analysis. The isotropic hardening elastoplastic hysteretic model was implemented to simulate the soil behaviour subjected to cyclic loading ranging from small to large strain amplitudes and account for stiffness degradation. The comprehensive dataset composed of the roller acceleration response and ground characteristics is then used to correlate the predicted soil modulus via an advanced machine learning approach. The adopted machine learning method incorporating Gaussian Kernel and Generalised Gegenbauer Kernel functions can reasonably predict the double-layered soil modulus during roller compaction.

Therefore, implementing Decision Analysis (DA) tool to systematically resolve such problems has been a common practice. The value of Information (VOI) framework acts as one of these tools that helps reservoir engineers to manage RM problems. Regarding this, the Least-Squares Monte Carlo (LSM) algorithm, which is one of the simulation-regression approaches, has been employed to estimate VOI for a better quality of decision-making (DM). Integration of the LSM algorithm in RM is coined as “Sequential Reservoir Decision-Making” (SRDM). This approximate method is essential to resolve a sequential decision problem with high dimensionality caused by many possible outcomes of uncertainties. This challenge is generally known as the “curse of dimensionality”. In this work, a modified LSM algorithm has been applied under the SRDM paradigm to optimize the waterflooding initiation time considering geological uncertainties. The modification considers the effects of information acquired previously and at the current decision time before a decision is made. The reservoir model used in this work is the OLYMPUS benchmark model. Apart from utilizing Linear Regression (LR) in the LSM algorithm, the use of two machine learning (ML) techniques, viz. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), have been illustrated to estimate the VOI. Based on the results, LR, GPR, and SVR correspondingly estimate the VOI as 11.52 million USD, 11.17 million USD, and 12.46 million USD. This means that SVR displays an improvement of 8.18% compared to the VOI assessed by LR. This shows its good applicability in VOI estimation and it can be concluded that integrating ML techniques into the SRDM paradigm demonstrates high potential for RM applications. © 2022 The Authors",Decision analysis; Machine learning; Optimization under uncertainty; Simulation-regression approach; Value of information; Waterflooding,Article,Scopus

Accordingly, we propose a new idea for non-destructive online acquisition of ETc data via mobile phones. The greenhouse environmental data were collected by sensors and uploaded to a mobile phone for the Penman-Monteith (PM) calculations of reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0). The canopy coverage (PGC) was accurately extracted from mobile phone images using the super-green algorithm, and four machine learning algorithms (XGBoost, CatBoost, SVR, and RF) were used to construct an online computing model for crop coefficient (Kc), ETc=Kc*ET0 was used to dynamically monitor the change of water requirement of different types of lettuce. The results showed that the correlation coefficients for the four monitoring networks were in the range of 0.74–0.93, which could be used to estimate the Kc at different stages. The integrated models showed high accuracy and similar performance. Compared with that of the SVR model, the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean square error (MSE) of the three algorithms were reduced. Regarding the generalisation and computational speed of the proposed approach, the estimation accuracy of the XGBoost model was improved by 17.31%, and the convergence speed was also increased by 12.57% relative to other models on different types of lettuce. The XGBoost model can be recommended as the Kc model for estimation. The daily mean values of leaf lettuce and head lettuce as measured in ETc were 2.38 mm d?1 and 6.22 mm d?1, respectively. The average errors were 3.48% and 6.36%, respectively. We further explored models of the mathematical relationship between Kc and the plant height (H), plant width (D), and normalised vegetation index (NDVI), to establish a new approach for reasonable and scientific irrigation management. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Crop coefficient; Crop evapotranspiration; Image processing; Machine learning,Article,Scopus

BCI-based Motor Imagery (MI) system bridges brain and external devices as communication tools to control, for example, wheelchair for people with disabilities, robotic control, and exoskeleton control. This success largely depends on the machine learning (ML) approaches like deep learning (DL) models. DL algorithms provide effective and powerful models to analyze compact and complex EEG data optimally for MI-BCI applications. DL models with CNN network have revolutionized computer vision through end-to-end learning from raw data. Meanwhile, RNN networks have been able to decode EEG signals by processing sequences of time series data. However, many challenges in the MI-BCI field have affected the performance of DL models. A major challenge is the individual differences in the EEG signal of different subjects. Therefore, the model must be retrained from the scratch for each new subject, which leads to computational costs. Analyzing the EEG signals is challenging due to its low signal to noise ratio and non-stationary nature. Additionally, limited size of existence datasets can lead to overfitting which can be prevented by using transfer learning (TF) approaches.

Introducing appropriate constraints into the loss function of a machine learning model can mitigate the negative impact of sample imbalance on model training. This study explores the role of Dice loss function in dealing with sample imbalance and verifies its application on the correction of heavy precipitation forecasts using the U-Net neural network. On this basis, the application of ordinal classification in forecasts correction is further verified. The results show that the concept of Dice loss is highly similar to that of threat score, which can suppress the negative impact of sample imbalance on heavy precipitation forecasts by ignoring most of the events that are insensitive to heavy precipitation forecasts. Model correction experiments further indicate that the correction models trained with weighted cross entropy, differentiable threat score loss and Dice loss (WCE, DTS and Dice models) improve the precipitation forecasts of ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) model. For the forecasts of all precipitation levels, Dice model effectively suppresses false alarms while improving hits, whereas WCE model greatly promotes false alarms while significantly improving hits. In contrast, DTS model significantly suppresses large precipitation false alarms while improving its hits, but causes substantial small precipitation false alarms while significantly promoting its hits. As a result, for large precipitation forecasts, both Dice and DTS models perform significantly better than WCE model, while for small precipitation forecasts, Dice model performs better than DTS and WCE models. Furthermore, the correction model combining ordinal classification and Dice loss exhibits the best forecasting skill. This model further suppresses the false alarms of large precipitation while improving its hits. © 2022",Correction; Data imbalance; Loss function; Machine learning; Precipitation,Article,Scopus

This artifact can quickly become too complex, which makes it challenging to maintain an SPL. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the artifact's maintainability continuously. The literature brings some approaches that evaluate FM maintainability through the aggregation of maintainability measures. Machine Learning (ML) models can be used to create these approaches. Objective: This work proposes white-box ML models intending to classify the FM maintainability based on 15 measures. Methods: To build the models, we performed the following steps: (i) we compared two approaches to evaluate the FM maintainability through a human-based oracle of FM maintainability classifications; (ii) we used the best approach to pre-classify the ML training dataset; (iii) we generated three ML models and compared them against classification accuracy, precision, recall, F1 and AUC-ROC; and, (iv) we used the best model to create a mechanism capable of providing improvement indicators to domain engineers. Results: The best model used the decision tree algorithm that obtained accuracy, precision, and recall of 0.81, F1-Score of 0.79, and AUC-ROC of 0.91. Using this model, we could reduce the number of measures needed to evaluate the FM maintainability from 15 to 9 measures. Furthermore, we created a mechanism to suggest FM refactorings to improve the maintainability of this artifact. FM maintainability evaluation and the refactoring suggestion mechanism were automated in the DyMMer tool. Conclusion: We conclude this work by presenting a way to combine FM maintainability assessment with FM refactorings.

Results demonstrated an accurate classification of patients with AD and FTD and HCs. A machine learning model produced the best values to differentiate AD from FTD patients with an accuracy = 0.91. The top features included social cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, executive functioning performance, and cognitive screening; with secondary contributions from age, educational attainment, and sex. Interpretation: Results demonstrate that data-driven techniques applied in archival clinical datasets could enhance diagnostic procedures in regions with limited resources. These results also suggest specific fine-grained cognitive and behavioural measures may aid in the diagnosis of AD and FTD in LAC. Moreover, our results highlight an opportunity for harmonisation of clinical tools for dementia diagnosis in the region.

Currently, constructions of virtual and physical health indicators (HIs) are commonly used methods for machine condition monitoring. However, most classic physical and virtual HIs lack inherent thresholds, robustness, monotonicity, and interpretability for machine condition monitoring. In this paper, a statistical learning modeling based HI construction method for machine condition monitoring is proposed to solve these problems. Firstly, a statistical decision theory is suggested to clearly describe a machine condition monitoring objective, and subsequently shapes of square envelope spectra are robustly modeled by using a parametric statistical model called a penalized B-spline approximation. Further, an interpretable HI named B-spline weight HI (BSWHI) as well as an inherent statistical threshold is accordingly constructed based on the Mahalanobis distance between B-spline weights of testing samples and a healthy sample. Experiments on bearing and gear run-to-failure datasets are studied to show that the proposed BSWHI and its inherent statistical threshold can effectively detect early machine faults and simultaneously provide monotonic degradation assessment trends. The proposed interpretable BSWHI has achieved a substantial improvement over existing classic HIs. © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.",B-spline modeling; machine condition monitoring; Mahalanobis distance; statistical learning modeling; statistical threshold,Article,Scopus

We show that it is possible to gain insight into the chemistry and chemical clustering/ordering tendency in different regions of the sample, including in the vicinity of nano-scale crystallites that are identified from virtual dark field images and in heavily deformed regions at the edge of the BMG. In addition to simpler analysis, unsupervised machine learning was used to extract partial PDFs from the material, modeled as a quasi-binary alloy, and map them in space. These maps allowed key insights not only into the local average composition, as validated by EELS, but also a unique insight into chemical short-range ordering tendencies in different regions of the sample during formation. The experiments are straightforward and rapid and, unlike spectroscopic measurements, don't require energy filters on the instrument. We spatially map different quantities of interest (QoI's), defined as scalars that can be computed directly from positions and widths of ePDF peaks or parameters refined from fits to the patterns. We developed a flexible and rapid data reduction and analysis software framework that allows experimenters to rapidly explore images of the sample on the basis of different QoI's. The power and flexibility of this approach are explored and described in detail. Because of the fact that we are getting spatially resolved images of the nanoscale structure obtained from ePDFs we call this approach scanning nano-structure electron microscopy (SNEM), and we believe that it will be powerful and useful extension of current 4D-STEM methods. © 2022 Acta Materialia Inc.",4D STEM; Metallic glass; Pair distribution function,Article,Scopus

This study proposes to formulate the FRP-concrete interfacial bond strength based on machine learning (ML) methods, which have emerged as a promising alternative to achieve high prediction accuracy in high-dimension problems. To this end, a database containing 1,375 FRP-concrete direct shear test specimens that failed due to interfacial debonding was established. The database was improved using an unsupervised isolation forest that identified and eliminated anomalous data, and was then used to train six ML models, namely artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine, decision tree, gradient boosting decision tree, random forest, and XGboost algorithms, to predict the FRP-concrete interfacial bond strength. The ML predictive models showed higher accuracy than 16 existing equations in the literature. The XGBoost model showed the highest accuracy, and its coefficient of variation was 54% lower than the existing equation with the highest accuracy among those considered. The ANN model was used to perform a parametric study on the influencing parameters, and a new equation was generated to predict the interfacial bond strength, considering the key influencing parameters. The equation enables interpretation of the ML models.

At coarse spatial resolution (> 100 m), clouds are bright and generally distinguishable from other landscape surfaces. At very high-resolution (< 3 m), detecting clouds becomes a significant challenge due to the presence of smaller features, with spectral characteristics similar to other land cover types, and thin (partially transparent) cloud forms. Furthermore, at this resolution, clouds can cover many thousands of pixels, making both the center and boundaries of the clouds prone to pixel contamination and variations in the spectral intensity. Techniques that rely solely on the spectral information of clouds underperform in these situations. In this study, we propose a multi-regional and multi-sensor deep learning approach for the detection of clouds in very high-resolution WorldView satellite imagery. A modified UNet-like convolutional neural network (CNN) was used for the task of semantic segmentation in the regions of Vietnam, Senegal, and Ethiopia strictly using RGB + NIR spectral bands. In addition, we demonstrate the superiority of CNNs cloud predicted mapping accuracy of 81–91%, over traditional methods such as Random Forest algorithms of 57–88%. The best performing UNet model has an overall accuracy of 95% in all regions, while the Random Forest has an overall accuracy of 89%.

Methods: Drawing on a 2018 survey of the preschool nutrition program conducted in the Xiangxi Autonomous Prefecture, Hunan Province, China, we applied propensity score matching to estimate the average treatment effects on the treated children. Results: The most striking result was that although poverty is often used as predictive of poor childhood nutrition, this effect was only significant for weight-for-age z-score and height-for-age z-score, but not for other nutritional indicators, cognition, or social emotional indexes. The results varied using different measures of poverty. The weak linkage between poverty and children's nutritional outcomes was confirmed by a series of robustness checks by changing the covariates for matching, adopting other matching methods, using bootstrapping standard errors, and building on machine learning tools. Conclusions: A single tool of small money transfer would have limited effects, but considerable income increases that lift the poor out of poverty are important for the poor.

In this study, a data mapping scheme based on fundamental atomic features was used to visualize the chemical composition characteristics mapped into two-dimensional grayscale image data to solve the problem of sparse material composition matrix. Based on this, a material composition visualization network (MCVN) is proposed and applied to predict the mechanical properties of steel and classify amorphous alloy materials. We compared the MCVN to other machine learning methods. The MCVN had an average R2 value improvement of 4% on the four targets in the National Institute for Materials Science's (NIMS's) steel dataset, where other models already get an average R2 of 0.92, and it achieved an R2 of 0.835 on the cross-sectional shrinkage target in the Shanghai Research Institute of Materials’(SRIM's) steel dataset where the other models only had an average R2 of 0.64.

Human intrusion into static hazardous areas is a significant cause of accidents. Traditional engineering safety management mainly relies on manual methods, such as patrol inspection by safety supervisors, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and it is difficult to achieve a complete safety supervision. In recent years, the emergence of artificial intelligence technology and computer vision has provided a new scheme for intrusion detection. However, existing studies have used a single method for human intrusion judgment in static dangerous areas, without in-depth consideration of the influence of human posture, intrusion direction, and other factors. In this study, a computer vision-based intrusion detection method was developed, mainly aimed at static hazardous areas. The object detection was based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) V5 module to extract the image feature information. Subsequently, the basic rule of intrusion judgment based on the key points of bounding boxes was formulated, in which the workers' intrusion direction was recognized and postured using two auxiliary detection modules. Finally, the intrusion rule base was constructed as the basis for human intrusion detection, containing rules with different sensitivities for different intrusion states. The case study indicated that the precision and recall rate of the algorithm were 96.05% and 90.05%, respectively.

The process divides into different stages, where the most important step is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the drugs after finding the best lead compounds. Several in-vitro methods have been developed to evaluate the toxicity of the drugs during the preclinical screening stage; however, these assays are super expensive and costly. However, the safety assessment of the drugs is very important to develop a very accurate and precise therapeutic application. Therefore, it is needed to design new alternative methods such as computational methods for high throughput drug designing and development for very precise and effective therapeutic applications. Development of highly advanced nature-inspired intelligent computing (NIC) technologies such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), ant colony optimization (ACO), DNA computing connected with the artificial immune systems, and machine learning helps in accurate drug designing, big data processing, integration of big data for the development of prediction models, disease-based image processing to evaluate pre- and post-drug effects on biological systems, etc. In this chapter, we provide a deep insight into the usage of nature-inspired intelligent computing technologies in drug design, development, and therapeutics. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",And machine learning and Artificial intelligence; Drug design; Drug development; Nature-inspired intelligent computing; Safety assessment,Book Chapter,Scopus

The air pollutants, e.g., CO, Ozone, PM10, NO, NO2, NOx, NH3, SO2, benzene, toluene, as well as meteorological parameters (temperature, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, evaporation, humidity, pressure, etc.), have been used as inputs in the present study.

Thus, this research suggests a hybrid machine-learning solution to replace traditional soil testing for determining OWC and MDD. The novel method combines the least square support vector machine (LSSVM) and symbiotic organisms search (SOS) algorithm. These two computational intelligence algorithms work together to create an OWC and soil MDD prediction model, LSSVM–SOS.

Overall, experimental results show that the proposed LSSVM–SOS has attained the most accurate prediction of the OWC of soils (RMSE = 0.0288, MAE = 0.0199, and R2 = 0.9656) and MDD (RMSE = 0.0305, MAE = 0.0206, and R2 = 0.9641).

This research introduces novel infrared thermal image-based approaches for facial emotion recognition. First, the entire image of the face is separated into four pieces. Then, we accepted only four active regions (ARs) to prepare training and testing datasets. These four ARs are the left eye, right eye, and lips areas.

Furthermore, we incorporated a parallelism technique to reduce processing-time in testing and training datasets. As a result, we have seen that the processing time reduces to 50%.

Previous work on thermal modeling by lumped-parameter thermal networks (LPTNs) suffers from mandatory expert knowledge for their design and from uncertainty regarding the required power loss model. In contrast, deep learning-based temperature models cannot be designed with the low amount of model parameters as in a LPTN at equal estimation accuracy. In this work, the thermal neural network (TNN) is introduced, which unifies both, consolidated knowledge in the form of heat-transfer-based LPTNs, and data-driven nonlinear function approximation with supervised machine learning. The TNN approach overcomes the drawbacks of previous paradigms by having physically interpretable states through its state-space representation, is end-to-end differentiable through an automatic differentiation framework, and requires no material, geometry, nor expert knowledge for its design. Experiments on an electric motor data set show that a TNN achieves higher temperature estimation accuracies than previous white-/gray- or black-box models with a mean squared error of 3.18 K2 and a worst-case error of 5.84 K at 64 model parameters. © 2022 The Author(s)",Functional safety; Hybrid machine learning; Permanent magnet synchronous motor; System identification; Temperature estimation,Article,Scopus

The results showed that the diameter in which the entropy is minimized increases by increasing the inner wall's thermal resistance. The best case is high thermal resistance in the outer walls and meager resistance in the inner walls. Using inner walls with high thermal resistance can decrease the adverse effects of entropy generation in large diameters. Also, the addition of nanoparticles is investigated, and the average Nusselt number and entropy generation, respectively, increased and decreased by almost 10%. Artificial neural network models are proposed to predict Nusselt number and entropy generation based on numerical results. The models are able to achieve MAE of lower than 3% and R2 higher than 0.95. © 2022",Artificial neural networks; Entropy generation; Geothermal heat exchanger; Machine learning; Nanofluid; Turbulent flow,Article,Scopus

Currently, data-driven models are mainly used for mid- to long-term streamflow forecasting. However, the evolution law of prediction models’ performance with increasing lead times has not been fully revealed due to too much attention on proposing a novel method to improve prediction accuracy. The main objective of this study was to explore the evolution law of the performance of ten-day streamflow forecasting models with the extension of lead time, including multiple linear regression, support Vector Regression, feedforward neural network, and least-squares Boosting Decision Tree. The upper reaches of the Yangtze River in China were considered as the case study region. The results show that: (1) with the extension of the lead time, the performance of data-driven models first decreases and then gradually levels off; (2) the inclusion of teleconnection climatic factors can improve the performance of each model; and (3) the randomness in streamflow can weaken the prediction ability of the models. These findings can promote improvements in mid- to long-term streamflow forecasting accuracy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Data-driven models; Evolution law; Machine learning; Teleconnection climatic factors; Ten-day streamflow forecasting,Article,Scopus

A total of 144 sets of ternary Ti-xAl-yV (0 ? x ? 11, 0 ? y ? 11, all in wt%) alloys were synthesized by DED, and the microstructure, microhardness, and yield strength of the alloys were rapidly characterized through image processing methods and instrumented micro-indentation. Backpropagation (BP) neural network models were developed to determine the microstructure parameters (average width of ?-laths, W?, and volume fraction of ?-phase, V?), microhardness, and yield strength as a function of the composition of DED Ti-Al-V alloys. The results showed that the V? increases linearly with increasing Al content and decreases with increasing V content. However, a nonlinear relationship between W? and contents of Al and V was found, which is mainly responsible for the nonlinear relationship between mechanical properties and composition.

Associations in rural areas are still unclear and there is growing interest in testing the role that air pollution has on other causes of death. This study aims to evaluate the association between daily air pollution and cause-specific mortality in all 8092 Italian municipalities. Methods: Natural, cardiovascular, cardiac, ischemic, cerebrovascular, respiratory, metabolic, diabetes, nervous and psychiatric causes of death occurred in Italy were extracted during 2013–2015. Daily ambient PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations were estimated through machine learning algorithms. The associations between air pollutants and cause-specific mortality were estimated with a time-series approach using a two-stage analytic protocol where area-specific over-dispersed Poisson regression models where fit in the first stage, followed by a meta-analysis in the second. We tested for effect modification by sex, age class and the degree of urbanisation of the municipality. Results: We estimated a positive association between PM10 and PM2.5 and the mortality from natural, cardiovascular, cardiac, respiratory and nervous system causes, but not with metabolic or psychiatric causes of death. In particular, mortality from nervous diseases increased by 4.55% (95% CI: 2.51–6.63) and 9.64% (95% CI: 5.76–13.65) for increments of 10 ?g/m3 in PM10 and PM2.5 (lag 0–5 days), respectively. NO2 was positively associated with respiratory (6.68% (95% CI: 1.04–12.62)) and metabolic (7.30% (95% CI: 1.03–13.95)) mortality for increments of 10 ?g/m3 (lag 0–5). Higher associations with natural mortality were found among the elderly, while there were no differential effects between sex or between rural and urban areas. Conclusions: Short-term exposure to particulate matter was associated with mortality from nervous diseases. Mortality from metabolic diseases was associated with NO2 exposure. Other associations are confirmed and updated, including the contribution of lowly urbanised areas.

DE-CBCT images acquired with two different spectra can provide material-specific information. Meanwhile, the anatomical consistency and energy-domain correlation result in significant information redundancy, which could be exploited to improve image quality. In this context, this paper develops the Transformer-Integrated Multi-Encoder Network (TIME-Net) for DE-CBCT to remove the limited-angle artifacts. TIME-Net comprises three encoders (image encoder, prior encoder, and transformer encoder), two decoders (low- and high-energy decoders), and one feature fusion module. Three encoders extract various features for image restoration. The feature fusion module compresses these features into more compact shared features and feeds them to the decoders. Two decoders perform differential learning for DE-CBCT images. By design, TIME-Net could obtain high-quality DE-CBCT images using two complementary quarter-scans, holding great potential to reduce radiation dose and shorten the acquisition time. Qualitative and quantitative analyses based on simulated data and real rat data have demonstrated the promising performance of TIME-Net in artifact removal, subtle structure restoration, and reconstruction accuracy preservation. Two clinical applications, virtual non-contrast (VNC) imaging and iodine quantification, have proved the potential utility of the DE-CBCT images provided by TIME-Net. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Dual-energy cone-beam CT; Limited-angle artifact removal; Material decomposition; Multi-encoder; Transformer,Article,Scopus

The emphasis here is not only to propose a low-cost micromechanics-based ML prediction system, but also to establish the linkage between microstructure features and RCF responses. In this prediction system, the hierarchical microstructure modeling approach and size-dependent physics-based crystal plasticity (CP) framework were developed to capture the micromechanical response of the martensitic steel in RCF. The hierarchical microstructure geometry, crystallographic orientation, and the corresponding fatigue indicator parameter (FIP) obtained from CP simulations were selected for database construction. The data filtering method was adopted by considering the loading history of RCF. The random forest (RF) algorithm was trained using the CP simulations to link the microstructure features to RCF performance.

Due to the difficulty in collecting the chiller's fault data, we usually face the data imbalance problem of less fault data and more normal data. To tackle this problem and further improve the fault diagnosis accuracy, this paper proposes a novel augmented data driven self-attention based deep learning model for the chiller fault diagnosis. Firstly, to solve the data imbalance problem, a stable synthetic minority oversampling technique (SSMOTE) is presented to generate the artificial fault data, which are then mixed with the raw fault data to achieve data augmentation. Further, to enhance the diagnosis accuracy, the self-attention mechanism based temporal convolutional network (STCN) is developed to classify normal and fault datasets. The developed STCN is realized by stacking the modified blocks which can dynamically pay attention to different data information through combining the self-attention mechanism and the traditional residual block together. What is more, in the STCN, the skip connection structure is added to the self-attention mechanism to solve the gradient disappearance problem. Finally, detailed experiments and comparisons are performed. Experimental results show that, compared with other data augmentation methods, the SSMOTE can complete a large scale expansion of the minority fault datasets, and its augmented data have better effect on handling the data imbalance problem. Moreover, the skip self-attention mechanism based deep learning model can achieve better diagnosis accuracy compared with some popular deep and shallow models, such as the LSTM, ELM and SVM, etc. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Chiller fault diagnosis; Deep learning; Imbalanced data; Skip self-attention,Article,Scopus

Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is highly promising for detecting such bacteria and for antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST). SERS is fast, non-destructive (can probe living cells) and it is technologically flexible (readily integrated with robotics and machine learning algorithms). However, in order to integrate into efficient point-of-care (PoC) devices and to effectively replace the current culture-based methods, it needs to overcome the challenges of reliability, cost and complexity. Recently, significant progress has been made with the emergence of both new questions and new promising directions of research and technological development. This article brings together insights from several representative SERS-based AST studies and approaches oriented towards clinical PoC biosensing. It aims to serve as a reference source that can guide progress towards PoC routines for identifying antibiotic resistant pathogens. In turn, such identification would help to trace the origin of sporadic infections, in order to prevent outbreaks and to design effective medical treatment and preventive procedures. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Antibiotic susceptibility test; Clinical diagnosis; Multidrug resistant pathogens; PoC biosensing; SERS; SERS-based biosensors,Review,Scopus

It is found that for CAM operation with large pre-charging voltage in the match line, the storage state in FeFET will be changed with the lower polarization near drain side, resulting in the strong non-uniformity of polarization along the channel direction. The lateral electric field generated by source and drain junction due to short channel effect will further exacerbate this effect. It is further shown that this distributed polarization effect may lead to significant circuit performance difference compared with uniform polarization situation, and may further degrade the search accuracy especially for multi-bit CAM.

The results indicate that the diurnal thermal range of the spatial-UTCI mean in summer (DTR(M)&lt;24?C) is double that in winter (DTR(M)&lt;12?C); meanwhile the maximum spatial-UTCI deviation is three times as significant (?&gt;3?Cat 7:00 BST versus ?&gt;1?Cat 12:00 GMT).

The proposed microenvironment exposure (ME) models incorporate PM2.5 measurements and individual time-activity information with a generalized estimating equation (GEE) analysis.

Ambient and home outdoor measures as exposure surrogates are likely to under- and overestimate personal exposure to PM2.5 in our study population, respectively. Measured and predicted indoor exposures were highly correlated with personal PM2.5 exposure.

The model incorporating home indoor PM2.5 can achieve the highest agreement (R2 = 0.790) with personal exposure and the lowest measurement error.

Radiation HTR is considered in the enclosure and there is a magnetic field (MGF) that can change the angle from horizontal to vertical affecting the NFD. This study is carried out for different angles of the enclosure and MGF from horizontal to vertical for radiation parameters (RDP) of 0 to 3 and a constant MGF with Hartmann number of 20 and Richardson number of 10. The aim is to estimate the Nusselt number (Nu), entropy generation (ETG), and Bejan number (Be).

The results demonstrate that the maximum value of Nu and Bes corresponds to the MGF angle and enclosure angle of 90°. The minimum value of the Nu and the maximum amount of ETG corresponds to the horizontal MGF and horizontal enclosure when the RDP is 1.5. An increment in the RDP enhances the amount of Nu.

The development of data-driven models for CRD and subtyping on whole-slide images (WSIs) would mitigate the burden of pathologists and improve their accuracy in diagnosis. However, the existing models are facing two major limitations. Firstly, they typically require large-scale datasets with precise annotations, which contradicts with the original intention of reducing labor effort. Secondly, for the subtyping task, the non-cancerous regions are treated as the same as cancerous regions within a WSI, which confuses a subtyping model in its training process. To tackle the latter limitation, the previous research proposed to perform CRD first for ruling out the non-cancerous region, then train a subtyping model based on the remaining cancerous patches. However, separately training ignores the interaction of these two tasks, also leads to propagating the error of the CRD task to the subtyping task. To address these issues and concurrently improve the performance on both CRD and subtyping tasks, we propose a semi-supervised multi-task learning (MTL) framework for cancer classification. Our framework consists of a backbone feature extractor, two task-specific classifiers, and a weight control mechanism. The backbone feature extractor is shared by two task-specific classifiers, such that the interaction of CRD and subtyping tasks can be captured. The weight control mechanism preserves the sequential relationship of these two tasks and guarantees the error back-propagation from the subtyping task to the CRD task under the MTL framework. We train the overall framework in a semi-supervised setting, where datasets only involve small quantities of annotations produced by our minimal point-based (min-point) annotation strategy. Extensive experiments on four large datasets with different cancer types demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in both accuracy and generalization. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Cancer region detection; Cancer subtyping; Computational pathology; Min-point annotation; Multi-task learning; Semi-supervised learning,Article,Scopus

Whereas, the second set represents the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients in Holland. Utilizing the same data sets, we carry out forecasting using three machine learning (ML) methods including support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and neural network autoregression (NNAR). To assess their forecasting performances, two statistical accuracy measures, namely, root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are considered.

Despite approaching expert-level diagnosis performance, convolutional neural network (ConvNet) adoption in clinical practice is impeded by their limited explainability, and by subjective, expensive explainability validations. We introduce DermX, an end-to-end framework for explainable automated dermatological diagnosis. DermX is a clinically-inspired explainable dermatological diagnosis ConvNet, trained using DermXDB, a 554 image dataset annotated by eight dermatologists with diagnoses, supporting explanations, and explanation attention maps. DermX+ extends DermX with guided attention training for explanation attention maps. Both methods achieve near-expert diagnosis performance, with DermX, DermX+, and dermatologist F1 scores of 0.79, 0.79, and 0.87, respectively. We assess the explanation performance in terms of identification and localization by comparing model-selected with dermatologist-selected explanations, and gradient-weighted class-activation maps with dermatologist explanation maps, respectively. DermX obtained an identification F1 score of 0.77, while DermX+ obtained 0.79. The localization F1 score is 0.39 for DermX and 0.35 for DermX+. These results show that explainability does not necessarily come at the expense of predictive power, as our high-performance models provide expert-inspired explanations for their diagnoses without lowering their diagnosis performance. © 2022 The Author(s)",Convolutional neural networks; Dataset; Dermatology; Explainability,Article,Scopus

Wi-Fi fingerprinting with received signal strength indicators (RSSI) has become one of the most practical techniques to localize users indoors. However, the fluctuation of wireless signals caused by fading, the multipath effect, and device heterogeneity leads to considerable variations in RSSIs, which poses a challenge to accurate localization. This paper proposes an indoor positioning method, which is constructed based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. Specifically, a novel model by combining an extreme learning machine autoencoder (ELM-AE) with a two-dimensional CNN is proposed. The ELM-AE extracts critical features by reducing input dimensions, while the CNN is trained to effectively achieve significant performance in the positioning phase. To increase positioning accuracy and deal with data shortages, a data augmentation strategy by frequently adding noisy data to the original fingerprint map is devised. The statistical properties namely, the RSS values of each MAC address, are utilized to adjust input noise. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated on two Tampere and UJIIndoorLoc datasets. The experimental results show that EA-CNN achieves better performance than CNN by decreasing average positioning error up to 40.95% and 43.74% in Tampere and UJIIndoorLoc datasets, respectively. Compared to state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods, the positioning performance improves up to 68.36% in Tampere and 67.56% in the UJIIndoorLoc dataset by exploiting only 25% of the training samples. Compared to several state-of-the-art deep learning models, EA-CNN achieves higher accuracy in both positioning and floor estimation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Convolutional neural network; Data augmentation; Extreme learning machine; Indoor positioning; Wi-Fi fingerprinting,Article,Scopus

One of the major systems influencing the safety of AVs is its navigation system. Road localisation of autonomous vehicles is reliant on consistent accurate Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning information. The GNSS relies on a number of satellites to perform triangulation and may experience signal loss around tall buildings, bridges, tunnels, trees, etc. We previously proposed the Wheel Odometry Neural Network (WhONet) as an approach to provide continuous positioning information in the absence of the GNSS signals. We achieved this by integrating the GNSS output with the wheel encoders’ measurements from the vehicle whilst also learning the uncertainties present in the position estimation. However, the positioning problem is a safety critical one and thus requires a qualitative assessment of the reasons for the predictions of the WhONet model at any point of use. There is therefore the need to provide explanations for the WhONet’s predictions to justify its reliability and thus provide a higher level of transparency and accountability to relevant stakeholders. Explainability in this work is achieved through the use of Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to examine the decision-making process of the WhONet model on an Inertial and Odometry Vehicle Navigation Benchmark Data subset describing an approximate straight-line trajectory. Our study shows that on an approximate straight-line motion, the two rear wheels are responsible for the most increase in the position uncertainty estimation error compared to the two front wheels. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Autonomous vehicles; Deep learning; Explainable machine learning; GNSS outage; Inertial navigation system; Neural networks; Positioning; Wheel odometry,Book Chapter,Scopus

They are used for a variety of applications throughout various industries like energy, aerospace, transportation, mining, agriculture, manufacturing, etc. The failure of gear may result in cataclysmic shutdowns causing significant production, economic losses and even human casualties. Fault diagnosis is an important component of condition-based maintenance and it has gained much attention for the safe operation of the gearboxes. But in many applications, fault diagnosis is not accurate. Sensor-based condition monitoring systems help in enhancing the quality of measurement data. A lot of research has been done in developing machine learning algorithms and models to extract information of fault status from the sensor data. Data acquisition of the meaningful sensor data from the gearbox is an open challenge. This makes the estimation of the remaining useful time of gearbox more challenging. This paper presents a literature review of the different IoT-based techniques used to acquire health status data from the gearbox. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Condition monitoring; Gearbox,Conference Paper,Scopus

Selected pairs of excitation/emission intensities at key wavelengths are inputs to an augmentation neural network (NN), trained using lab-based measurements, that generates synthetic high-resolution spectra. Then, an image processing NN is used to estimate the contaminant concentrations from the spectra generated from a few key wavelengths. The presented approach is tested using naphthenic acids, phenol, fluoranthene and pyrene spiked into natural waters. The spills or loss of containment of these contaminants represent a significant risk to the environment and public health, requiring accurate and rapid detection methods to protect the surrounding aquatic environment. Results were compared with models based on only the corresponding peak intensities of each contaminant and with an image processing NN using the original spectra. Naphthenic acids, fluoranthene and pyrene were easy to detect by all methods; however, performance for more challenging signals to identify, such as phenol, was optimized by the proposed method (peak picking with mean absolute error (MAE) of 30.48 µg/L, generated excitation-emission matrix with MAE of 8.30 µg/L).

Wind energy consists in extracting energy from wind speed, and because of the uncertain and intermittent behaviour of this meteorological parameter, wind turbines output power cannot be optimally exploited. Although the vast majority of the research in wind speed forecasting field has consisted in the purpose of novel algorithms, these studies have not made a pre-processing step of the data in order to try to extract the maximum information from databases. Therefore, the goal of this paper consists in analysing whether the combination of time-frequency decomposition of wind speed data with different machine learning algorithms can increase the accuracy of current wind speed predictions for 10 min ahead. Obtained error metrics demonstrated that the deviation of developed wind speed forecaster was lower than 0.1% in 62% of the validation database. In addition, the root mean square error of the final forecaster was 0.34 m/s.

In this paper, a three-dimensional scaled steel plate model (120 mm × 24 mm × 6 mm) is built for numerical simulations to replace the expensive physical WAAM experiments. A series of thermo-metallo-mechanical analyses is conducted by using ABAQUS CAE user subroutines in which, thermal, metallurgical and mechanical models for gas metal arc welding (GMAW) process are implemented. Groups of variables in WAAM process namely wire melting current, voltage and torch moving speeds, as well as interval layer cooling coefficients, are chosen as input parameters of the artificial neural network (ANN). The two targeted values are hardness and ultimate strength of the steel plate model, which are obtained by fully coupled thermo-metallo-mechanical simulations or by quick results from commercial software JmatPro, and by real measurements on the test samples of WAAM experimental plates. In this primary study, Taguchi algorithm is used for data preparations of the numerical experiments. The tests are fulfilled with Neural Networks (NN) tool in MATLAB. A typical three-layer feedforward network is used for general works. The developed models show good prediction capability for hardness and ultimate strength. The ANN algorithm presents high potential in bidirectional modeling to develop the WAAM strategy tool. It is possible to realize the inverse modeling from properties obtained by fractions of phase volume to WAAM processing parameters. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Additive manufacturing; ANN; FEM simulation; Inverse modelling; Machine learning; WAAM,Article,Scopus

Because of the growing size and complexity of these models, it’s becoming more difficult to grasp how they arrive at their forecasts and when they go incorrect or even worse. Now, think of a situation in which we humans could open these black-box learning models and translate the content into a human-understandable format. This is known as Explainable Artificial Intelligence and there has been a lot of research in this field over the last few years mainly focusing on how to explain different types of models. The advancement of this research, raised a very important query: “Why does a model need to be explained?” So, the most accurate answer to this question is “TRUST”. TRUST that the models are making the correct decisions over the correct assumptions. TRUST that we can tell what happened when a model fails. TRUST that we can do on a model implemented on a large scale that the predictions are made in line with expectations. It’s hard to trust a system that’s not transparent about its internal processes.

Deep learning-based methods can learn design experience from existing design data and generate new designs efficiently. However, existing research is insufficient for the design of the local layout of shear walls in critical zones. The attention mechanism can identify the critical zones in an image that must be focused on and provides a new potential solution for improving the local design of shear wall structures. Therefore, this study proposed an attention-enhanced generative adversarial network model, named StructGAN-AE, for the intelligent design of shear wall structures. Additionally, a pre-training method was proposed to overcome the limitation of data shortage. Case studies showed that, compared with existing models, StructGAN-AE could generate a more reasonable local layout of shear walls in critical zones, such as elevator shafts, and the rationality of the generated shear walls was improved. The comprehensive evaluation metric of shear wall design results was improved by up to 30%. In terms of structural performance, the shear wall structures designed using StructGAN-AE demonstrated better anti-torsion performance, closer to engineers’ design, and lower consumption of concrete and steel than those designed using existing methods. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Attention mechanism; Generative adversarial network; Machine learning; Shear wall layout design; Shear wall structure,Article,Scopus

This study investigates the possibility of applying functional variables of ecosystem retrieved from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard sensor data to map the species distribution of two alpine treeline species, namely Betula utilis D.Don and Rhododendron campanulatum D.Don over the Himalayan biodiversity hotspot. In this study, we have developed forty-nine Novel Earth Observation Variables (NEOVs) from MODIS products, an asset to the present investigation. To determine the effectiveness and ecological significance of NEOVs combinations, we built and compared four different models, namely, a bioclimatic model (BCM) with bioclimatic predictor variables, a phenology model (PhenoM) with earth observation derived phenological predictor variables, a biophysical model (BiophyM) with earth observation derived biophysical predictor variables, and a hybrid model (HM) with a combination of selected predictor variables from BCM, PhenoM, and BiophyM. All models utilized topographical variables by default. Models that include NEOVs were competitive for focal species, and models without NEOVs had considerably poor model performance and explanatory strength. To ascertain the accurate predictions, we assessed the congruence of predictions by pairwise comparisons of their performance. Among the three machine learning algorithms tested (artificial neural networks, generalised boosting model, and maximum entropy), maximum entropy produced the most promising predictions for BCM, PhenoM, BiophyM, and HM. Area under curve (AUC) and true skill statistic (TSS) scores for the BCM, PhenoM, BiophyM, and HM models derived from maximum entropy were AUC ?0.9 and TSS ?0.6 for the focal species. The overall investigation revealed the competency of NEOVs in the accurate prediction of species' fundamental niches, but conventional bioclimatic variables were unable to achieve such a level of precision. A principal component analysis of environmental spaces disclosed that niches of focal species substantially overlapped each other. We demonstrate that the use of satellite onboard sensors’ biotic and abiotic variables with species occurrence data can provide precision and resolution for species distribution mapping at a scale that is relevant ecologically and at the operational scale of most conservation and management actions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Alpine species distributions; Conservation and management; Machine learning algorithms; MODIS; Niche overlap; Remote sensing,Article,Scopus

The lack of well-labeled training image data has significantly impeded the development of novel DL methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in mineral thin section images identification. However, image annotation, especially pixel-wise annotation is always a costly process. Manually creating dense semantic labels for rock thin section images has been long considered as an unprecedented challenge in view of the ubiquitous variety and complexity of minerals in thin sections. To speed up the annotation, we propose a human–computer collaborative pipeline in which superpixel segmentation is used as a boundary extractor to avoid hand delineation of instances boundaries. The pipeline consists of two steps: superpixel segmentation using MultiSLIC, and superpixel labeling through a specific-designed tool. We use a cutting-edge methodology Virtual Petroscopy (ViP) for automatic image acquisition. Bentheimer sandstone sample is used to conduct performance testing of the pipeline. Three standard error metrics are used to evaluate the performance of MultiSLIC. The result indicates that MultiSLIC is able to extract compact superpixels with satisfying boundary adherence given multiple input images. According to our test results, large and complex thin section images with pixel-wise accurate labels can be annotated with the labeling tool more efficiently than in a conventional, purely manual work, and generate data of high quality. © 2022 The Authors",Image annotation; Mineral thin section images; Pixel-wise labeling; Superpixel segmentation,Article,Scopus

In the NSGA ? algorithm, brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), NOx and CO2 are optimized by changing the engine control parameters including spark angle, VVT-I (intake), VVT-E (exhaust) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). The engine GT-Power physical model is used to generate training data for the SVM, and verify the accuracy of the results of NSGA ? algorithm during the optimization process. The SVM with fast calculation speed is used in the calculation of NSGA ? fitness evaluation. In addition, enhancing training is utilized to improve the accuracy of the SVM model in this research. When the optimization method is applied to the Atkinson cycle gasoline engine, its high efficiency has been presented. In the three plans obtained by GT-Power physical model with all four parameters optimized, the maximum reduction rates of BSFC, NOx, CO2 and CO (g/kW·h) reached 7.07%, 35.90%, 6.62% and 5.50% respectively. The SVM model is compared with back-propagation algorithm, and the result proves that SVM is more suitable for such problems. Finally, based on the Pareto optimal solution obtained by the optimization method, it significantly promotes the solution of multi-objective optimization problems. Theoretically, the time cost of the optimization method in this paper can reach 1/23 of that for the optimization algorithm directly driving physical model. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Atkinson cycle gasoline engine; Back-propagation algorithm; Digital twins; Enhancing training; NSGA ? algorithm; Support vector machine algorithm,Article,Scopus

We find firstly that categorical EPU indices are predictable for carbon futures volatility, but the predictive power of individual categorical EPU indices is not robust. Secondly, machine learning methods, especially the machine learning method considering the Markov regime switching structure, help to obtain valid information from multiple categorical EPU indices and produce robust and superior prediction accuracy for carbon futures volatility. The results of the extension analysis also found that machine learning methods, especially the machine learning method considering the Markov regime switching structure help to produce higher investment performance and more accurate long-term carbon futures volatility forecasts. Meanwhile, we also find the advantages of the MIDAS based machine learning methods over the traditional AR based machine learning methods. Finally, the forecasting performance of the machine learning method which considering Markov regime switching structure are superior during both the low and high volatility regimes and even during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Carbon futures volatility; Categorical EPU indices; Machine learning method; Volatility forecasting,Article,Scopus

This study presents a new modular framework, called the Deep Neural Network-Genetic Algorithm (DNN-GA) architecture, to predict aerodynamic damping directly from surface pressure measurement while serving as one of the earliest references for GA applications in aerodynamic damping predictions. The accurate prediction can give building engineers better insights into potential designs' feasibility at substantially reduced costs, benefiting building design and engineering implementations. The DNN-GA is demonstrated on an aeroelastic tapered prism—a nonlinear bi-directional fluid-structure interaction (FSI) system with solid connections to building design—with synchronous, high-fidelity wind tunnel data for training and prediction. With pressure input, the DNN module predicts tip response as the intermediate product, based on which the GA module optimizes for aerodynamic damping in a fully automated workflow. Results showed that the DNN-GA outperformed six benchmark machine learning algorithms by at least 400%. A comparison between the GA module and the traditional Random Decrement Technique (RDT) showed an accuracy improvement of at least 700%.

However, many K factor maps have a coarse spatial resolution at the regional scale, and high-resolution mapping is still a challenge. Quantitative analysis of the influence of environmental factors such as soil, topography, climate, and vegetation, and human activities on the K factor is also lacking. Therefore, we mapped the high-resolution (90 m) spatial distribution of the K factor values in southeastern Tibet using a random forest model with multiple environmental variables, based on remote sensing, ground observations (114 sampling points), and gridded datasets. The K factor estimates based on soil particle size composition and organic carbon content ranged from 0.09 to 0.35, showing moderate variation. The random forest model yielded a coefficient of determination > 0.9 and provided detailed information on the spatial distribution of K factor values, especially in large unsampled areas. The predicted K factor values tended to be high in the eastern area and low in the western area. Partial least squares path modeling showed that soil physical properties such as fractal dimension and mean weight diameter of aggregates had the largest influence on the K factor (path coefficient 0.695). Climate and topography also had a considerable influence on the K factor (path coefficient ?0.489 and ?0.469, respectively), while the influence of vegetation and human activities was minimal. Accordingly, the random forest model is an effective tool for high-resolution spatial distribution mapping of the K factor with limited sampling data. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Driving factors; Machine learning; Qinghai-Tibet Plateau; Soil erodibility,Article,Scopus

In view of recent events of corona virus people are required to wear face masks to protect themselves from getting infected. As a result, a good portion of face (nose and mouth) is hidden by the mask and hence the facial recognition becomes difficult. Many organizations use facial recognition as a means of authentication. Researchers focus on developing rapid and efficient solutions to deal with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic by coming up with suggestions for handling the facial recognition problem. This research paper aims to identify the person, while the face is covered with a facial mask with only eyes and forehead being exposed. The first step involves marking the facial region. Next, using the data set, we will implement an object detection model YOLOv3 to identify unmasked and masked faces. The YOLO v3 object detection model is the best performing model with a detection time of 0.012 s, F1 score of 0.90 and mAP score of 0.92.

This new era of marketing has seen customers to be more participative, more curious of something that is new and different, and businesses are focusing on machine learning (ML) to understand customer’s psychology. Traditionally, marketing was considered to be the synthesis of the four main elements of the marketing mix to satisfy customer needs, and there was a one-way communication: business to consumers (B2C). However, two decades after the twenty-first century, consumer experiences, information management, and predictive analytics are main factors to determine future trends. Practitioners argue that Marketing 3.0 is similar to Marketing 2.0 where customers’ involvement and participation contribute to the overall business marketing process, but what is new is emotional marketing where individuals’ needs and aspirations are also considered. With the advancement in information communications technology (ICT) and Web 3.0, the emergence of social media platforms has transformed the communication channels in marketing. Social media is an important marketing communication tool where customers share their experiences among themselves and businesses as well. Consumers’ shared experiences, information, and knowledge management together with predictive analytics are the main factors that are used in Marketing 4.0 to predict future consumer buying behavior. The aim of this paper is to go beyond the acceptance of ICT and understand its contribution in the future of marketing. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",AI in marketing; Always-connected marketing; Marketing 4.0,Conference Paper,Scopus

Gender-Based Violence (GBV) is also a major issue in social media. As a part of GBV, hate speech against women is on the rise on all social media. There are some lapses available in the stand-alone classifiers in detecting such speech, and the performance of ensemble classifiers is much better. Also, many research works have focused on common hate speech datasets. Hate speech against women has been used in very few research activities. But such hate speech is very dangerous. As a result, this research employs, Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to compute metrics and performances and then use those algorithms to create a voting classifier to develop a more accurate model for detecting hate speech against at women. Two phases were used in this study. RF, LR, DT, and LSTM were used as foundation stand-alone classifiers in the first phase of the ensemble procedure. In Phase Two, the weights of the second-level classifier were estimated using first-level classifiers. Hate speech against women was detected using an open-source #MeToo dataset that was utilized for training and testing by the researchers. The dataset is publicly available on GitHub which was uploaded by Nazmus Sakib. This dataset consists of 278,765 #MeToo movement posts on social media. It clearly shows that the proposed voting classifier model has the highest values in all metrics including accuracy (89%). When we check the strongly positive classification, the proposed model has performed well in precision (0.90), recall (0.91), and F-measures (0.90) and it can calculate strong positive hate speech more efficiently than other stand-alone classifiers. This voting model takes more time to train since it has multiple models inside.

The data was gathered from the WHO and studied to see if there was a link between the number of current cases, those who died, and those who recovered. The model was entirely based on multiple regression, support vector machine, and random forest which fits as an effective tool for prediction and error reduction. Based on the dataset taken from March 16, 2020, to August 20, 2020, from the ICMR website, the mean absolute error (MAE) of SVM is less for Odisha and multiple linear regression is less for India. The multiple learner regression model is able to predict number of active cases properly as its R2 score value are 1 and 0.999 for Odisha and India, respectively. Machine leaning model helps us to find trends of effected cases accurately.

Glaucoma is an eye disease which is mainly responsible for vision impairment. So it is necessary to detect the presence of Glaucoma in the early stages. If detected in the early stage we can control our intra ocular pressure by adopting lifestyle changes and by using some other medications. The lifestyle changes may include exercising regularly and reducing stress. Hence the early detection of Glaucoma can help people from losing their vision. A machine learning model has been proposed which tells the Glaucoma percentage of the eye. In this we are giving a fundus image as the input to the model and it tells the Glaucoma percentage. This Glaucoma percentage can be detected using two things that are optic cup and optic disk. To measure the Glaucoma percentage it is necessary to find the optic cup ratio to optic disk ratio. Generally health eye optic cup ratio to optic disk ratio is less than 0.5. In Glaucoma eye the optic cup ratio to optic disk ratio is greater than 0.5.

A language-independent summarization system that can be effortlessly extended to other such languages, which could have a limited number of resources to carry out such research is required. In this paper, we examine the efficiency of supervised linear regression models for the performing single document extractive automatic text summarization on Konkani language folktales dataset. We use 13 language-independent features and linear regression models to learn feature weights. These weights are then used to calculate a sentence’s score; top ranking sentences are then chosen for summary generation. We employ a k-fold evaluation strategy to evaluate the system-generated summary against a human-generated summary using ROUGE evaluation toolkit. Additionally, we also evaluate the use of L1 and L2 regularization on the summarization task. The work represents early attempts in automatic text summarization pertaining to Konkani language, and the dataset employed in these experiments is unique and devised particularly to facilitate research in this domain.

Cusped field thrusters (CFTs) are advantageous over other electrostatic types such as gridded ion engines and Hall Effect thrusters, featuring enhanced electron confinement enabled by magnetic mirror using permanent magnets hence longer lifetime expectation. Physical modeling and characterization of performance are essential for design optimization of CFTs, but rather few research efforts have been dedicated to them to date. A multi-objective design optimization study is performed in the present study, based on evolutionary algorithms incorporating magnetic simulation coupled with an improved power balance model. It aims to simultaneously maximize the performance parameters, namely thrust, total efficiency, and specific impulse, with the anode voltage and current, mass flow rate, and magnet radii employed as the decision variables. Covariance-based global sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify influential design parameters. Uncertainty analysis is performed using prediction from surrogate models via machine learning by means of Monte Carlo simulation to examine the effects on uncertainties in the design parameters on the performance parameters. The plasma behavior inside the channel and the plume region has been investigated with primary focus on the magnetic field strength. In so doing, physical insights have been gained into key design factors to maximize CFT performance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Cusped field thruster; Electric propulsion; Multi-objective design optimization; Surrogate modeling; Uncertainty analysis,Conference Paper,Scopus

It is still a challenging task in artificial intelligence and human–computer interaction due to its high intra-class variation. Facial emotion analysis achieved more appreciation in academic and commercial potential challenges mainly in the field of behaviour prediction and recommendation systems. This paper proposes a novel scattering approach for recognizing facial dynamics using image sequences. Initially, we extract the temporal information from the facial frame by applying a saliency map and hyper-complex Fourier transform (HFT). Later the extracted high-level features are fed to the scattering transform method and machine learning algorithms to classify the seven emotions from the MUG dataset. The performance of proposed wavelet scattering network was evaluated on four different machine learning algorithms and achieved a high rate of recognition accuracy in all classes. In the experimental results, K-NN exhibits the proposed architecture’s effectiveness with an accuracy rate of 97% for the MUG dataset, 95.7% for SVM, 93.7% for decision tree and 91.2% naive Bayes, respectively. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Facial emotion analysis; Feature descriptors; Hyper-complex Fourier transform; Wavelet scattering,Conference Paper,Scopus

This study aims to explore supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to build a surrogate prediction model for SMRFs to reduce the need for complex modeling. For this purpose, twenty well-known ML algorithms implemented in Python software are trained based on the dataset achieved from Incremental Dynamic Analyses (IDAs) performed on the 2-Story, 3-Story, 4-Story, 5-Story, 6-Story, 7-Story, 8-Story, and 9-Story SMRFs modeled in Opensees. Then, important features of weight, fundamental period of structure (T1), the RSN number of record subsets, the direction of the record subsets, soil types, and Sa(T1) of analysis, which affect the results of predictions, were selected by trial and error. Having these important features, data-driven techniques developed in Python software were compared for predicting the M-IDR of SMRFs as target. Results showed that ML algorithms of GPReg, PLSReg, SReg, LReg, GReg, MLPReg, SVM, and LSVR had lower values of coefficient of determination (R2 lower than 0.5) in both train and test datasets. In addition, XGBoost, BReg, HistGBR, and ERTReg algorithms achieved higher values of R2 (i.e. upper than 0.95 in the 5-Story SMRF) with low Mean Squared Error (MSE) for prediction of M-IDR. Therefore, using these algorithms mitigates the need for computationally expensive, time-consuming, and complex analysis, while preliminary prediction of M-IDR can be considered a low computational and efficient tool for seismic vulnerability assessment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Data-driven techniques; Machine learning algorithm; Maximum interstory drift ratio; Seismic vulnerability assessment; Supervised learning,Article,Scopus

Thus, computational connectivity between the patients at home and the hospitals needs to be established. The objective of this paper is to propose a framework/model that connects all the stakeholders so that either in regular monitoring or in emergency cases help can be provided to them.

Using this theory as the standard basis, machine learning models like SVM, Naïve Bayes, and decision trees can be used for the analysis, diagnosis, and prediction. Using IoT and its variants, remote monitoring of patient, and consultation can be provided to the patient. Appropriate action would be taken. In addition, a mobile application would enable the patients to gather or read about experiences of other patients.

They allow the description of the transformation rules that link the different metamodels concepts.

In order to keep a high level of personal health, the doctors suggest to do fitness exercises. Before the pandemic it was possible to do these exercises at the gym or during dedicated session in the office supervised by professional trainers. During the pandemic emergency the gyms were closed, the workers were forced to stay home and the people started to do gym exercises by themselves without the control of a professional figure. This situation could lead to several diseases associated to musculoskeletal disorders if the exercises are performed incorrectly. In this work, an approach based on the pose-estimator application OpenPose is developed. The reference exercise is an isometric squat performed by a professional trainer. During the exercise, thanks to a deep neural network, the pose-estimator gets a series of key-points and vectors which represent the user’s pose. A dataset of videos (for both the correct and incorrect postures) has been used to train several machine learning algorithms. The result is an automatic tool that recognizes incorrect poses during the exercise and helps the performer to correct it. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Computer vision; Ergonomics; Machine learning; Physiotherapy; Posture assessment,Conference Paper,Scopus

Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm often used in topic modelling. The output of the topic modelling algorithm can be used logically to classify documents. The LDA model is plagued with domain-specific terms. A novel latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with domain knowledge framework for document classification was introduced. The experiment was carried out using a dataset with five different categories of data.

It provides the most flexible, rider-friendly, quick travel even in traffic-choked streets and narrow roads, exhibiting entirely different characteristics in terms of travel speed, and trip lengths compared to other paratransit modes like taxicabs. Reported studies on the behaviour of paratransit mainly concentrated on taxicabs and hence there is a need to analyse the travel behaviours of motorised three wheelers. In this regard, the present study aims to understand and characterise the travel patterns of motorised three wheelers. In addition, travel time prediction is an inevitable aspect for demand-responsive paratransit services like motorised three wheelers, taxicabs etc. It helps both the drivers and passengers to make smart choices about the routes by avoiding congested streets and to have information about the pickup and arrival time. The present study proposes a methodology using Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict the travel time of motorised three wheelers by incorporating the trip characteristics under heterogenous lane less traffic conditions.

The novelty of this approach is that it uses elements of the Montessorian theory, the phenomenon of addictive reflexes by Ivan Pavlov and the learning levels model suggested by Prensky. The Montessorian theory states that the subject has free choices in the learning environment while Pavlov states that the user can be forced into a specific reflex with constant positive or negative reinforcement. On top of these, with the usage of Prensky’s model, we create an endogenous learning process. Considering these theories, the reply mechanism of the game constructs personalized feedback that can aid the user through the levels of the game rendering the learning progress more natural and personalized. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2D platform game; Environmental awareness; Game development; Human-machine interaction,Conference Paper,Scopus

The linear regression achieve optimal performance with only minimum feature inputs while the Random Forest and the Gradient Boosting methods achieve comparable prediction errors to that of the linear regression models. Furthermore, optimal results of the random forest was achieved with Time-related features and the meteorological factors, specifically the rainfall (RF) and relative humidity (RH).

However, due to similar joint appearance and unobservable connection area, evaluating joint quality nondestructively is difficult. This paper presents a quality inspection using the similarity between typical joints (templates) and tests to solve the difficulty. Templates corresponded to joints with deformations ranging from insufficient to excessive (categories 0–4), and the intermediate was qualified. Deformed shapes of the joints on coaxial sections were analytical features to make the most of the correlation between shape and quality. Detailed analysis on quality-related shape avoids unobservable areas and explores subtle differences. Shapes were extracted from the structure light image using the Steger-based algorithm. Self-attention network, a machine learning algorithm, learned the shapes of typical joints to form a comparator. The comparator was used to determine which template shape (types 0–4) the different shapes of the test joint were similar to. The test joint category depended on which type has the maximum ratio in shape prediction. Steger extracts shapes without the discrete spots effect, abnormal and missing values. The comparator accuracy is 0.9701, 0.9841 and 0.9881 for training, validation, and testing. The F1 of the qualified category is 0.98. The untrained joints were used as validation. The maximum ratios are 0.878, 0.842, 0.764, 0.469, and 0.997, whose predicted categories coincide with the real ones. This proves that it is feasible to design inspection based on process characteristics. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Feature similarity; Machine learning; Magnetic pulse crimping; Quality inspection; Self-attention; Steger-based algorithm,Article,Scopus

As plantations expanded, sustainability becomes critical to ensure the fields pass the relevant environmental, social and economic benchmarks. Oil palm trees are susceptible to basal stem rot disease (BSR) caused by the pathogenic fungus Ganoderma boninense. BSR is a fatal and contagious disease which causes a sharp decline in oil palm yields and significantly threatens the production and economic performance of oil palm plantations. Early detection is key to limiting the damage of a BSR infection. Traditional manual detection of BSR is prone to human error and inconsistencies. In response, a number of methods using satellite imagery, spectral imaging and thermal imaging had been introduced with varying degree of success. Alternatively, machine vision (MV) with image processing and feature extraction by deep learning algorithms had been proposed with improved accuracy and feasibility. This paper reviews information on BSR including its stages of infection, symptoms and diagnosis, as well as existing MV models for disease detection in palm-related plants. Additionally, this paper also details the methodology for development of a new MV model for BSR detection based on the Inception convolutional neural network deep learning algorithm. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Basal stem rot; Convolutional neural network; Disease detection; Machine vision; Oil palm,Conference Paper,Scopus

Initially, the face is detected using the Haar cascade classifer to extract the temporal information from the facial frame by applying a scale invariant feature transform by combining a bag of visual words. Later, the extracted high-level features are fed to machine learning algorithms to classify the seven emotions from the MUG dataset.

As a result of the growing economy, organizations of scale have a significant portion of their infrastructure over technology which makes the organization vulnerable. The security teams of such organizations work to patch such vulnerabilities as they come across them but may spend a significant amount of organization resources fixing vulnerabilities that may not be exploited. After conducting our own research on the existing methods to prioritize vulnerabilities that have a higher probability of being exploited, we found that machine learning can be used to make the process of vulnerability prioritization efficient. This paper discusses our research on using machine learning for vulnerability prioritization and the different machine learning algorithms that can be of use for the same.

The optimized problem is established by combining the parametric design software, such as Rhino grasshopper and 3D Karamba, with an applied Octopus. The post-optimized geometric sections archive symmetric forms and high strength when a typical C section combines each other based on the golden ratio. Besides, the proposed sections are evaluated with the experimental results using a finite element analysis to increase the proposed approach’s reliability.

As technology is advancing, we can add or take out crucial features from a picture without any trail of tampering. Therefore, its authenticity is called into question especially when images have impressive power. Copy-move is a kind of forgery, where portions of a picture are transformed and inserted into the same picture. Copy-move forgery detection is one such research domain that has put forward various methods to find out copy-move forgery. Many techniques based on image processing and machine learning have been put forward to detect the forgery. Since the duplicated parts are from the same image, many of the features will be similar to the rest of the image making it difficult to detect forgery using the latest methods. In this work, we propose to use SIFT keypoint-based forgery detection with clustering for quickly identifying copy-move forgeries in highly textured regions. As the SIFT keypoints are difficult to detect in smooth regions, we propose to use Hu’s invariant-based block-based forgery detection strategy to detect the missing cases.

These HCP MFCC vectors work as a standard comparison index for all cough samples to detect any respiratory disorders. The evaluation of the proposed method is done using 40 samples of COVID-19 patients of which 20 are positive and 20 are negative. The accuracy of the proposed method is compared with that of the standard MFCC method for the same set of samples. The proposed HCP MFCC method produces results that are 7.84% more accurate than the standard method.

Rather, a scene is described with several features which the agent has been trained to recognize. Specifically, scenes are generated by extracting features from the space’s occupancy, the location of the light source, shape of the object, colors, and textures in the images. The extraction of the features is conducted by ensemble with deep-learning based feature extractors, traditional machine learning algorithms and image processing techniques. The deep-learning based feature extractors are trained by a supervised learning with data augmentation over 3D models; and the results of inferences are evaluated by a depth camera and retrained by unsupervised learning. Using existed methods it is difficult to utilize semantic information for unknown objects. But the agent in this methodology tries to describe them as much as possible by utilizing information trained in advance. For an odometry module, which estimates attitudes and positions, is implemented by a typical feature-based visual odometry methodology. The camera coordinate frame’s depth camera points and the pixel plane’s points are optimized by Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm after extracting a typical corner detection algorithm and tracking by an optical flow algorithm. Using several key-frames, sliding-windowed PnP (Perspective-n-Point), algorithms can be constructed. The visual odometry of the camera and the attitude estimation from the IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) are loosely coupled. An ARS (Attitude Reference System) is built with a quaternion based linear Kalman filter, and mainly compensates the rotation error of the sliding-windowed PnP algorithm for each frame. The positions of the recognized objects are also included in the PnP algorithm to cover up the lack of features due to the lack of light or motion blur, which are a major problem in feature-based odometry. Since the re-recognized objects’ positions anchor the odometry, the drift problem which commonly occurs can also be solved. This framework performs a rough 3D reconstruction by interpreting the scene with minimal computing resources, and obtains the location of the agent. Therefore, it offers a simple 3D map and a graph structure, as a by-product for applications using this framework, and provides the attitudes and positions of agents for each frame. For applications that do not necessarily require dense geometric results, I propose that this framework can be utilized as a flexible and versatile component with fewer computer resources. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Ensemble vision machine learning; Scene reconstruction; Scene understanding; SLAM; Visual-inertial odometry,Conference Paper,Scopus

Reliable extrapolation requires two-sided asymptotic matching. Most existing databases provide support on only one extreme of the range of size, time or failure probability, but theoretical support can be obtained for the asymptotic behaviors on both sides of the range. The advantage is that the asymptotics are much simpler than the behavior in the central, transitional, range.

The main issue is blood-related problems because blood is the foundation of our body. Cancers related to blood are very critical and cause human death. Leukemia is a kind of most cancers that arises inside the bone marrow and outcomes in an excessive wide variety of peculiar white blood cells. If acute leukemia cannot be treated in a short time, there is less time for humans to survive. It is important to detect cancer at an early stage and be able to treat it. It takes more time to cure so early detection is vital for treating cancers. In this research, machine learning is used to predict cancer cells in the blood. So, we used convolutional neural networks (CNN) to train the model and find cancer cells in the blood at an early stage. This research shows the prediction of blood cancer cells and displays the differences between the normal and cancer cells image using CNN classification process. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Acute leukemia; Convolution neural network; Lymphoid cells; Myeloid cells,Conference Paper,Scopus

Against this background, we develop insights into the significance of deepfakes for firms and consumers—the threats they pose, how to mitigate those threats, and the opportunities they present. Our findings indicate that the main risks to firms include damage to image, reputation, and trustworthiness and the rapid obsolescence of existing technologies. However, consumers may also suffer blackmail, bullying, defamation, harassment, identity theft, intimidation, and revenge porn.

The pandemic has changed human life, attitude, and behavior. This pandemic added a burden to people’s life and health. With the new variants of SARS-CoV-2, a lot of people are even scared of going to the health centers to get the COVID-19 evaluation in fear of contamination and contagious, which caused the surge in the symptoms at later stages. Data collected across various sources can play an important role in predicting and identifying of COVID-19 virus based on the models and the classifications of this data using the most sophisticated machine learning models. The concern here is accessing or transferring an individual’s data from their personal health devices which defers users’ privacy. In the recent past, there are a lot of research that has been done these days on how blockchain can help to securely track and transfer the data across trusted sources. Adding to this, federated learning also is helping on-device data usage without any critical data to be transferred to various external sources. The proposed study directs the stability of frequent health status with the help of wearable devices that capture health metrics like heart rate, blood oxygen levels, breathing rate, muscle activities, stress, emotions, movement patterns, sleep activity, precipitation, and mind/cognitive functions with the introduction of the data streams and models that can seamlessly transfer the data, with the assurance of data integrity, privacy, and control which is the scope of this paper. The usage of both the emerging technologies provides a value addition in terms of health data exchange with effective data distribution with decentralized privacy and computation. We have also introduced a consent-based personal health device registration mechanism on a blockchain consensus network with digital identity to allow and take back controls over who can access their data.

The core of our proposal is a multi-objective hierarchical symbolic regression algorithm able to compute cluster-specific rankings of regression models ordered by increasing complexity. We discover the hierarchical structure by clustering the features’ importances of a post-hoc explainability framework (viz., SHAP) applied to a highly flexible predictive model (viz., XGBoost). We rely on a symbolic regression algorithm based on the simulated annealing meta-heuristic to infer sparse linear models which may include non-linear effects (e.g., log-transforms, multiplicative interactions…). This search is guided by two objectives: Maximizing predictive performance and minimizing complexity. It ends on a list of Pareto-optimal models that fosters a dynamic interpretative process: the user navigates from the least to the most complex model and decides the ones he can trust depending on whether he understands them, and whether he is satisfied by the quantified uncertainty of their parameters and predictions. Our approach achieves promising results when compared to more than ten other interpretable or black-box predictive models on eleven public regression datasets of various volumes, dimensionalities or domains, and on a proprietary dataset for highway crash prediction. On this last dataset, we demonstrate the usefulness of our new ranking-by-complexity of inherently interpretable models. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Machine learning; Model interpretability; Multi-objective optimization; Symbolic regression,Article,Scopus

Inferring such shape models arises as a key step towards accurate personalized simulation that enables an automated assessment of the cardiac chamber morphology and function.

However, they are generally developed in a supervised manner which requires a considerable number of input features and corresponding capacities, leading to prohibitive costs and efforts for data collection. In response to this issue, this study proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) based method to perform end-to-end capacity estimation by taking only raw impedance spectra as input. More importantly, an input reconstruction module is devised to effectively exploit impedance spectra without corresponding capacities in the training process, thereby significantly alleviating the cost of collecting training data. Two large battery degradation datasets encompassing over 4700 impedance spectra are developed to validate the proposed method. The results show that accurate capacity estimation can be achieved when substantial training samples with measured capacities are given. However, the estimation performance of supervised machine learning algorithms sharply deteriorates when fewer samples with measured capacities are available. In this case, the proposed method outperforms supervised benchmarks and can reduce the root mean square error by up to 50.66%. A further validation under different current rates and states of charge confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our method provides a flexible approach to take advantage of unlabelled samples for developing data-driven models and is promising to be generalised to other battery management tasks. © 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences",Capacity degradation; Deep learning; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Lithium-ion battery,Article,Scopus

The collection of illness symptoms is necessary for disease prediction. For an accurate prognosis, this general illness prediction takes into account the person's lifestyle and medical history. When it comes to illness prediction, ANFIS outperforms CNN by a wide margin (96.7%). ANFIS, on the other hand, does not require as much time or memory to train and test because it does not use the UCI repository dataset. There are several libraries and header files included with the Anaconda (Jupyter) notebook that make Python programming more precise and accurate. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",ANFIS; CNN; Disease prediction; Machine learning,Conference Paper,Scopus

Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Calculating toolpath in machining can be fastidious and often pass through a selection of an extensive set of options and parameters. Automatic toolpath calculation has been a challenge for decades. Reinforcement learning is a good candidate to teach an agent “good trajectories” and then let the agent determines the trajectory for any new case. In the proposed paper, reinforcement learning has been tested to learn toolpath calculations in turning. In a first attempt, simple tuning part has been tested. The paper will present the environment, the different codification, the reinforcement learning algorithm and the reward systems proposed and tested. It has been verified, for all these options, that the agent learns and then that it can reapply what it learns on new parts. The paper concludes that reinforcement learning is a promising direction for toolpath calculation and draw some perspective toward its generalisation in the CAM systems. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Artificial intelligence; Computer Aided Manufacturing; Machining,Conference Paper,Scopus

We will create an ensemble of classifiers to increase the current state-of-the-art accuracy. We will also investigate data preprocessing techniques like segmentation, masking, and feature engineering for an improvement in the overall precision. We will compare the performance as well as their impact on the final ensemble. To overcome this challenge, traditional techniques use complex convolution layer-based neural network architectures like Resnet and VGG-19.

The relationships of the three types of NCCV intensity with atmospheric circulations in late summer, the sea surface temperature (SST), and Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) in the preceding months, are analyzed. The sensitivity tests by the Community Atmosphere Model version 5.3 (CAM5.3) are used to verify the statistical results. The results show that the coordination pattern of East Asia-Pacific (EAP) and Lake Baikal high pressure forced by SST anomalies in the North Indian Ocean dipole mode (NIOD) during the preceding April and SIC anomalies in the Nansen Basin during the preceding June results in an intensity anomaly for the first type of NCCV. While the pattern of high pressure over the Urals and Okhotsk Sea and low pressure over Lake Baikal during late summer—which is forced by SST anomalies in the South Indian Ocean dipole mode (SIOD) in the preceding June and SIC anomalies in the Barents Sea in the preceding April—causes the intensity anomaly of the second type. The third type is atypical and is not analyzed in detail. Sensitivity tests, jointly forced by the SST and SIC in the preceding period, can well reproduce the observations. In contrast, the results forced separately by the SST and SIC are poor, indicating that the NCCV during late summer is likely influenced by the coordinated effects of both SST and SIC in the preceding months. © 2023, Institute of Atmospheric Physics/Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Arctic sea ice; Indian Ocean sea surface temperature; machine learning method; model sensitivity test; Northeast China cold vortex; path classification,Article,Scopus

Therefore, a multi-level homogeneous ensemble predictive (MLHoEP) model is designed, which uses the different techniques of data mining like feature selection, ensemble learning techniques like boosting and bagging. Seven distinct machine learning algorithms were used on this model to predict and analyse the academic performance of the students. The performance of the classification algorithms in terms of prediction was evaluated using k-fold cross-validation. The study contributes to the body of knowledge by suggesting the development of homogeneous classifiers that may be used to accurately predict students’ academic success. It also proposes the construction of homogeneous classifiers, which may be deployed for accurate student performance prediction, in order to provide a better explanation for the poor performance prediction. As a result of this research, it has been demonstrated that the technique of applying homogeneous ensemble approaches is incredibly efficient and accurate in terms of predicting student performance and assisting in identifying students, who are in danger of dropping out of school. The study compared the accuracy and efficiency of single classifiers to ensembles of classifiers in terms of performance. It was discovered in the research that a homogeneous model with excellent accuracy and efficiency might be developed for anticipating student performance. These key problems have been successfully addressed by the findings of this research study: Which characteristics of students are the most effective predictors of academic performance? How accurate are approaches such as bagging and boosting ensembles for predicting student academic performance? The approach offered in this study will aid educational administrators and policymakers in designing new policies and curriculum-linked to student retention in higher education. This research can also aid in the identification of students who are at risk of dropping out of school early, providing for timely intervention and support. Prospective research will examine the creation and implementation of an automated prediction system known as the students’ academic performance forecast framework, which will collect data from students via online submission and produce a prediction result for their academic performance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Correlation attribute evaluation; Educational data mining; Ensemble learning; Gain ratio; Information gain; Multilayer perceptron; Naïve Bayes; Random forest,Conference Paper,Scopus

It is a universally accepted process to measure the punctuality of a student. However, there are certain drawbacks to the existing system where a teacher has to physically mark, whether a student is present or not. The main drawbacks of taking physical attendance are time-consuming while marking the attendance and there is a possibility of proxy attendance. The existing systems like fingerprint scanning and RFID are not completely proof worthy and can be easily tampered with. Keeping this view in mind, we implement a face recognition algorithm to mark the attendance of a student. The main aim of the proposed system is to make the process efficient and save time. The proposed system recognizes the student’s face from the images stored in the database and updates it in the attendance sheet automatically. To implement the online attendance system, we use popular algorithms like Haar-Cascade and HOG algorithm which is provided by the face_recognition library. As most of the face recognition algorithms work on 2D frames, they are unable to overcome the problem of spoofing, where the person’s face gets recognized from a photo. This problem of spoofing is dealt with the help of the eye-blinking detection CNN model and trained using Keras. The proposed system uses OpenCV and Machine Learning techniques to perform the complete process. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Convolutional neural network; Face-recognition; Haar cascade classifier; Histogram of gradients; OpenCV,Conference Paper,Scopus

Women with GDM are at an increased risk of complications during pregnancy and during delivery. The offspring and the mother are also at an increased risk of getting diabetes in the future. Therefore, careful screening is necessary to avoid further complications. The objective of this research is to facilitate proper prediction of the presence of GDM in women so that timely intervention can help prevent future adversities. Multiple machine learning algorithms with data analysis methods are employed to investigate the probability of GDM and reach an optimal solution. The methodology makes use of the latent factor model and stochastic gradient descent to account for the missing data. Information entropy is used to calculate the amount of information each variable presents. The final classification is done and compared using three methods.

From the beginning of the COVID-19 vaccination program, many people have refused to accept the vaccine due to widespread misconceptions and propaganda concerning the COVID-19 virus itself, whether it is real or not, and the vaccination program as well. All these misconceptions and propaganda have been spreading through word of mouth (verbal) discussion among citizens. In this study, a hybrid machine learning approach was proposed with the help of natural language processing to build a sentiment classification and prediction system using the data collected from the public regarding their opinions on the COVID-19 vaccination program. The data was collected through the Google Form. The evaluation metrics used to measure the effectiveness of the proposed work were accuracy, precision, recall, and f-measure. Various machine learning algorithms were used for the implementation. Two algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine and Bagging Classifier, outperformed the remaining algorithms with the same accuracy and precision scores of 75%, respectively. The two algorithms were considered for the voting, which served as the final hybrid machine learning model for the sentiment classification and prediction tasks. The voting classifier works by predicting an output voting class based on the highest likelihood of the combined models, which were Bagging Classifier and SVM. Using the voting classifier, accuracy, and precision scores of 75% and 75% were also obtained. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Accuracy; Bagging classifier; COVID-19 vaccination; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Precision; Sentiment analysis; Support vector machine; Voting classifier,Conference Paper,Scopus

However, deriving such nonlinear conservation laws is a significant and challenging problem. A possible attractive approach is to extract conservation laws more directly from observation data by use of machine learning methods. We propose a framework that combines a symbolic multi-layer neural network and a discrete scheme to learn the nonlinear, unknown flux function f (u) of the scalar conservation law ut + f (u)x = 0 (?) with u as the main variable. This identification is based on using observation data u(xj, ti) on a spatial grid xj, j = 1, …, Nx at specified times ti, i = 1, …, Nobs. A main challenge with Eq (?) is that the solution typically creates shocks, i.e., one or several jumps of the form (uL, uR) with uL ? uR moving in space and possibly changing over time such that information about f (u) in the interval associated with this jump is sparse or not at all present in the observation data. Secondly, the lack of regularity in the solution of (?) and the nonlinear form of f (u) hamper use of previous proposed physics informed neural network (PINN) methods where the underlying form of the sought differential equation is accounted for in the loss function. We circumvent this obstacle by approximating the unknown conservation law (?) by an entropy satisfying discrete scheme where f (u) is represented through a symbolic multi-layer neural network. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method has the ability to uncover the hidden conservation law for a wide variety of different nonlinear flux functions, ranging from pure concave/convex to highly non-convex shapes. This is achieved by relying on a relatively sparse amount of observation data obtained in combination with a selection of different initial data. © 2023 licensee AIMS Press.",discrete scheme; entropy condition; flux function; machine learning method; nonlinear conservation law,Article,Scopus

The clinical symptoms of Covid-19 show resemblance with acute respiratory distress syndrome. The major clinical symptoms linked with this disease are fever, cough, headache, migraine, and breathlessness. Despite tremendous research going on, knowing the way of transmission and its early detection remains a mystery. There is no treatment as of now for this virus, so a lot of unprecedented containment and mitigation policies such as closure of business places, schools, and colleges, marriage gathering restrictions, transport restrictions, and social distancing are being employed. These policies are able to limit the transmission of covid-19, but are not always feasible. Steps must be taken to slow down the spread of this virus and make an early diagnosis of infection to save lives. This paper gives a clear idea about the introduction of Covid-19, its symptoms, post covid-19 symptoms, challenges posed by the virus, and proposed solutions for its early detection to slow down its rate of transmission. Methods: The proposed solution includes a clustering algorithm for massive contact tracing that helps to slow down the transmission rate, and automatic virus detection and classification network known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based upon deep domain transfer learning. Results: The pre-trained model VGG-19 is used and the hyperparameters of the model are tuned as per classification requirement by exploiting the concept of deep domain transfer learning. The model is implemented on publicly available chest radiography images and the system classifies the dataset as covid and non-covid images. The CNN achieves 97.35 % accuracy outperforming all the existing methods. A new concept of employing nanocoating and nano sprays is also introduced in the paper. Conclusion: To discuss various critical challenges posed by Covid-19. Addressing those issues and proposing various solutions.

It plays a decisive role to forward our country’s economic development. Crop cultivation has been the most prominent problem in recent days due to changes in weather patterns. This has a significant impact on crop productivity, either directly or indirectly. As a result, new technologies might be brought up for use in order to overcome this problem and uplift crop output. In this research proposal, we have explored IoT by choosing the smart farm and digital technology and explaining the management of heterogeneous data for agriculture. We proposed an IoT-HELE-based smart farming prediction and intelligent agriculture analytics model and a decision support system that effectively predicts crop production by utilizing cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning techniques. In this model, ensemble voting results in a more efficient, sustainable, and profitable agriculture enterprise. The multi-source dataset from the National Research Council (CNR), an ISTAT, and an IoT sensor will be analyzed.

This method, however, requires a large number of numerical simulations demanding high computational costs. This paper explores the efficiency of machine learning (ML) models and Artificial Neural Networks used as surrogate models trained on a limited number of random field slope stability simulations in predicting the results of large datasets. The paper explores the efficiency of the predictions on the probability of failure using databases with and without factor of safety (FOS) computations. An extensive range of soil heterogeneity and anisotropy is examined on unstratified and layered slopes. On datasets requiring only the examination of failure or non-failure class of slopes (without FOSs), the performance of ML classification of the random field slope stability results generally reduces with higher anisotropy and heterogeneity of the soil. However, using the probability summation method proposed here, ML prediction of the probability of failure is shown to be highly accurate for the whole range of soil heterogeneity and anisotropy. The errors in the predicted probability of failure using 5% of MC data is only 0.46% in average for the prediction of the remaining unseen 95% of data. Offering such accuracies, the approach accelerates the computations for about 100 folds. The models also proved similarly efficient in predicting FOSs for stratified random field anisotropic heterogenous slopes. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Anisotropy; Heterogeneity; Machine learning; Monte Carlo; Slope stability; Surrogate models,Article,Scopus

This study focuses on breast cancer as well as on prostate cancer in the direction of their early predictions. For early prediction, eight classification models had been used such as logistic regression (LR), Naïve Bayes (NB), decision tree (DT), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN). This work includes three different datasets for research analysis of breast and prostate cancer predictions. Two datasets for breast cancer (Coimbra and Wisconsin) and one for prostate cancer are taken from UCI and Kaggle repository, respectively. For improving the results of prediction, the normalization technique and feature selection method had been used in this paper. Performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and curves of each classifier are analyzed in this study. Most of the classifiers did well after using the feature selection method (ANOVA).

Terrorism is a term we use to refer to violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims. Terrorism has been around for about two centuries, but it did not gain much traction until the 1970s. Terrorism is defined as violent acts against innocent people committed to making an impact on society or government. The underlying causes of terrorism are usually motivated by injustice, revenge, oppression, retaliation, conflict, and hostility borne out of inequality among countries. Furthermore, it is associated with religious extremism and usually targets civilian populations to cause death or destruction. As a result of these patterns in manifestation and potential consequences worldwide, terrorism has become a pressing global issue that requires attention at multilateral levels. In this article, we have tried to cover all the aspects of terrorist data analysis using various machine learning algorithms like support vector machine and linear regression. After analyzing the above datasets by the said model, we have figured out which region is mainly affected by attacks and where the cases of terrorists have been seen frequently. Here, we have tried to explain what it means to do this kind of research and provide some considerations for those who want to use this approach for their work. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Data analysis; Linear regression; Prediction; Support vector machine; Terrorism,Conference Paper,Scopus

Various biotechnological approaches form the core for finding the drug for COVID. But at the backend, it is highly supported by intensive computational algorithms for drug designing approaches. Artificial intelligence is one such area that can be used to mimic the living system by training it with multi-dimensional datasets. The rapid advancements in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning have facilitated to build high-accurate generative models. Deep learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that is being used in the present study for ligand designing models. The results obtained by a deep learning-based model called variational autoencoder—general adversarial networks (VAE-GAN) show promising results in terms of ligand design and can also be utilized for drug repurposing. In this paper, we have attempted to build a VAE-GAN model which was trained on isomeric simplified molecular-input line-entry system (Iso-SMILES) data and molecular structure images of the COVID-19 drug dataset. The Iso-SMILES and molecular structure data analysis are useful, but the system needs more improvement to cater to the data loss in terms of spatial structures and orientation of the chemical compounds taken for the analysis. However, the system can be optimized with the help of higher hardware support and increased training datasets, which can help in more precise analysis for generating ligand molecules of interest. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",COVID-19; Deep learning; Generative adversarial networks; Generative models; Variational autoencoders,Conference Paper,Scopus

To reduce the traffic on backhaul links, Content-Centric Networking (CCN) as a promising network architecture has been applied to UDN recently. However, its in-network caching mechanism is subject to Cache Pollution Attack (CPA), where attackers aim to occupy limited caching space with unpopular contents. Existing studies focusing on the static networks cannot be directly used in dynamic UDN scenarios. In this paper, we propose a detection and defense scheme of CPA based on federated learning, where CPA is determined by the cooperation of multiple SBSs. First, each SBS can build or join a cluster based on the metrics of distance similarity and load similarity. Then, each cluster head as the working node trains the local classifier to detect CPA based on the statistics within the cluster. The macro base station aggregates all the local models to generate an improved global classifier for all the SBSs. In our scheme, federated learning as a special case of distributed machine learning allows each cluster head to independently train the local data even when it is non-i.i.d. or unbalanced. Simulation results show that our scheme outperforms in terms of detection ratio, cache hit ratio, access delay, and false alarm ratio compared with other state-of-the-art schemes. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",5G; Cache pollution attack; Content centric network; Federated learning; Ultra-Dense network,Article,Scopus

Differently, for the processes of clustering and classifying in the framework, the grey incidence analysis (GIA) method is first proposed to measure the similarity level of two sequences; and the GIA-based clustering and classifying (GIACC) method is suggested. The ensemble model with multiple appropriate machine learning models as its base learners for RUL prediction is trained for each cluster, aiming to achieve good prediction accuracy and high computational efficiency.

Some technology-based software is required to help in medical field to recognize heart patients with more accuracy and lesser time. Huge amount of heart patients are present in different hospitals in all over the world, which can be used efficiently to diagnose the heart disease by applying data mining techniques. In the process of data mining, knowledge or useful information is extracted among the large sets of raw data. In the prediction analysis, machine learning techniques are applied to discover valuable patterns and forecast future events or trends. This research work will predict the likelihood of coronary heart disorder in patients by implementing a modified machine learning algorithm. The input data are passed through various procedures comprising preprocessing, clustering, and selection of effective attributes before classification. To determine the heart illness, four algorithms which include random forest, K-means, genetic algorithm, and logistic regression are assimilated. In this technique, the irrelevant attributes of heart dataset are discarded to improve the performance and to decrease the training period time. This process is completed by random forest technique. K-means clusters are optimized by genetic algorithm in order to group all the outlier data points. At last, logistic regression is applied to classify the patients based on the heart disease.

However, general FL settings cannot meet requirements in decentralized environments, especially in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, where a fully connected central server is unavailable due to limited communication ranges. In this paper, to satisfy the requirements of security, privacy preservation, and robustness in the context of FL in P2P networks, we propose a decentralized global model training protocol, named PPT. Particularly, PPT aggregates local model update parameters in a single-hop manner and uses the symmetric cryptosystem to ensure secure communications between network nodes where an enhanced Eschenauer-Gligor (E-G) scheme is proposed for secure key distribution. Further, PPT generates random noise for privacy preservation without reducing the model accuracy since the noise is eliminated ultimately. PPT also adopts game theory to resist collusion attacks. In addition, PPT has elaborate designs in terms of communication efficiency and dropout-robustness. Through extensive analysis, we demonstrate that PPT can resist various security threats and preserve user privacy. Ingenious experiments on Trec05, Trec06p, Trec07, and SMS Spam Collection v.1 confirm the 20× and 12× improvement of computation efficiency that PPT achieves compared to Google's Secure Aggregation and Local Differential Privacy (LDP)-based FL methods. More importantly, the global model trained by PPT is better than that trained by LDP-based FL methods in terms of prediction performance (about 14% and 1% improvement in convergence rate and accuracy). © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Decentralized; Efficiency; Federated learning; Peer-to-peer networks; Privacy-preserving; Security,Article,Scopus

This may become particularly relevant in light of recent efforts to identify magnetic resonance imaging–derived biomarkers that yield insight into pathophysiological processes as well as to refine the taxonomy of mental illness. In particular, the accuracy of machine learning models may be used as dependent variables to identify features relevant to pathophysiology. Moreover, such approaches may help disentangle the dimensional (within diagnosis) and often overlapping (across diagnoses) symptomatology of psychiatric illness. We also point out a multiview perspective that combines data from different sources, bridging molecular and system-level information. Finally, we summarize recent efforts toward a data-driven definition of subtypes or disease entities through unsupervised and semisupervised approaches. The latter, blending unsupervised and supervised concepts, may represent a particularly promising avenue toward dissecting heterogeneous categories. Finally, we raise several technical and conceptual aspects related to the reviewed approaches. In particular, we discuss common pitfalls pertaining to flawed input data or analytic procedures that would likely lead to unreliable outputs. © 2022 Society of Biological Psychiatry",Biomarker; Heterogeneous dissection; Machine learning; Multiview integration; Nosology; Psychiatric disorder,Review,Scopus

A rapid and objective urban ecological environment assessment (UEEA) plays an important role in the urban sustainable development and environment protection. This study established an improved urban ecological comfort index (UECIIMP), which is based on our previous UECI and fully composed of four remote sensing indicators: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), land surface temperature (LST), and aerosol optical depth (AOD), representing the greenness, dryness, heat, and atmospheric turbidity, respectively. Combining the entropy method and random forest (RF) algorithm, the weights of four indicators were calculated. To improve the accuracy of UECIIMP, the gap-filled quarterly mean results of each indicator with 30m resolution were obtained using the harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS) method and spatial-temporal information fusion based on non-local means filter (STNLFFM). UECIIMP was applied to the Hefei-Nanjing-Hangzhou Region to explore its spatiotemporal changes and response characteristics. Results show that the weights of UECIIMP fluctuate slightly (within 10%) before and after sensitivity analysis, with good stability and reliability. UECIIMP in Hangzhou &gt; Hefei ?

The correlation between UECIIMP and economic index indicates that economic development has a positive impact on the urban ecological environment. The significant degradation of UECIIMP in the urban expansion area demonstrates a negative impact on the local environment from urban expansion. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Entropy method; Random forest; Remote sensing; UECIIMP; Urban ecological environment assessment (UEEA),Article,Scopus

We also contribute two implementations based on our theoretical results: one leverages ideas from syntax-guided synthesis while the other makes use of stochastic local search techniques. The two implementations are evaluated by recovering synthetic and benchmark models from contextual examples. The experimental results support our theoretical analysis, showing that MAX-SAT models can be learned from contextual examples. Among the two implementations, the stochastic local search learner scales much better than the syntax-guided implementation while providing comparable or better models. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Combinatorial optimisation; Constraint learning; Contextual examples; Machine learning; Maximum satisfiability; Soft constraints,Article,Scopus

Most current techniques are intrinsically black-box systems, suffering from two generalizability issues in clinical practice. First, benign-malignant discrimination is often assessed by human observers without pathologic diagnoses at the nodule level. We termed these data as “unsure-annotation data”. Second, a classifier does not necessarily acquire reliable nodule features for stable learning and robust prediction with patch-level labels during learning. In this study, we construct a sure-annotation dataset with pathologically-confirmed labels and propose a collaborative learning framework to facilitate sure nodule classification by integrating unsure-annotation data knowledge through nodule segmentation and malignancy score regression. A loss function is designed to learn reliable features by introducing interpretability constraints regulated with nodule segmentation maps. Furthermore, based on model inference results that reflect the understanding from both machine and experts, we explore a new nodule analysis method for similar historical nodule retrieval and interpretable diagnosis. Detailed experimental results demonstrate that our approach is beneficial for achieving improved performance coupled with trustworthy model reasoning for lung cancer prediction with limited data.

We find a frequency interpretation by linking the variation of the eigenvectors of the random walk operator obtained from their Dirichlet energy to the real part of their associated eigenvalues.

This controversy has caused uncertainty across the software engineering community, affecting levels of commitment to the many potential determinants of quality among developers. An up-to-date catalogue of software quality views could provide developers with contemporary guidelines and templates. In fact, it is necessary to learn about views on the quality of code on frequently used online collaboration platforms (e.g., Stack Overflow), given that the quality of code snippets can affect the quality of software products developed. If quality models are unsuitable for aiding developers because they lack relevance, developers will hold relaxed or inappropriate views of software quality, thereby lacking awareness and commitment to such practices. Objective: We aim to explore differences in interest in quality characteristics across research and practice. We also seek to identify quality characteristics practitioners consider important when judging code snippet quality. First, we examine the literature for quality characteristics used frequently for judging software quality, followed by the quality characteristics commonly used by researchers to study code snippet quality. Finally, we investigate quality characteristics used by practitioners to judge the quality of code snippets. Methods: We conducted two systematic literature reviews followed by semi-structured interviews of 50 practitioners to address this gap. Results: The outcomes of the semi-structured interviews revealed that most practitioners judged the quality of code snippets using five quality dimensions: Functionality, Readability, Efficiency, Security and Reliability. However, other dimensions were also considered (i.e., Reusability, Maintainability, Usability, Compatibility and Completeness). This outcome differed from how the researchers judged code snippet quality. Conclusion: Practitioners today mainly rely on code snippets from online code resources, and specific models or quality characteristics are emphasised based on their need to address distinct concerns (e.g., mobile vs web vs standalone applications, regular vs machine learning applications, or open vs closed source applications). Consequently, software quality models should be adapted for the domain of consideration and not seen as one-size-fits-all. This study will lead to targeted support for various clusters of the software development community. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Code snippet quality; Software quality; Stack Overflow,Article,Scopus

Furthermore, recognizing the effective factors in the performance reduction of the SERNs in different working conditions can be very helpful in optimizing them.

However, they have not been fully understood, especially when crystalline imperfections are present. Here, using cadmium telluride (CdTe) as an example, we illustrate how grain boundaries (GBs) affect the thermal transport properties of semiconductors. We develop a machine-learning force field from density functional theory calculations for predicting the lattice thermal conductivity (LTC) via equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. The LTC of crystalline CdTe decreases with the relationship of ?L?1/T in the simulation temperature range of 300 – 900 K, in which the isotropic LTC decreases from 3.34 to 0.23 W/(m?K) due to the enhanced anharmonicity. More important, after introducing GBs, the LTC is suppressed in all directions, especially in the direction normal to the GB planes. More severe LTC suppression occurs in CdTe with ?9 GB than that with ?3 GB at 300 K, decreasing by 92.8% and 61.4% along the direction normal to the GB planes compared to the isotropic LTC of the crystalline CdTe, respectively. The decreased LTC is consistent with the weaker bonding near GB planes and lower shear modulus of the defective material. The analyses of the phonon dispersion curves, vibrational density of states, and phonon participation ratio indicate that the decreased LTC mainly arises from phonon scattering at GBs. Overall, our work highlights that GBs can greatly influence the LTC of semiconductors, thus providing a promising approach for thermal property design. © 2022",CdTe; Grain boundary; Lattice thermal conductivity; Machine-learning force field; Molecular dynamics,Article,Scopus

Firstly, regarding the rock joint profile as a time series signal, the time–frequency spectrogram was drawn through the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to comprehensively characterize the undulation location and degree of joint, and describe the roughness feature information of the joint profile more clearly and accurately. Then, the deep convolutional neural network was combined to extract and learn the features of the time–frequency spectrogram, and the roughness coefficient of the rock joint profile was identified, which effectively recovered the deficiency of the traditional artificial formulation feature parameters. The experimental results showed that compared with the conventional empirical regression method and machine learning (ML) models, the identified joint roughness coefficient based on deep learning of the time–frequency spectrogram was more consistent with the true value, and the calculation results were more reasonable and reliable, with higher recognition accuracy and generalization ability.

Detecting and classifying multiple type of attacks requires robust machine learning approaches that can analyze network traffic and take appropriate measures. Traffic data usually consists of redundant, irrelevant, and noisy information, which could have a negative influence on the model performance. In this paper, we propose an improved bio-inspired meta-heuristic algorithm for efficient detection and classification of multi-stage attacks. The proposed model uses a one-versus-all sub-model based technique to deal with the multi-class classification problem. Each sub-model employs an enhanced Harris Hawk optimization with extreme learning machine (ELM) as the base classifier. This hierarchy produces the best subset of features per attack, along with optimized ELMs weights, which can improve the detection rate significantly. The proposed technique was tested against various meta-heuristic algorithms and multi-class classifiers using the UNSWNB-15 dataset. In seven different types of attacks, experimental results outperformed other existing methods in terms of decreasing the crossover-error rate and obtaining the best values for the G-mean measure. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Crossover error rate; Extreme learning machine; Feature extraction; Intrusion detection system; Swarm intelligence,Article,Scopus

Once deployed, models should be accurate for classes seen during training while providing informative estimates of uncertainty to flag abnormalities and unseen classes for further analysis. Although recent developments in uncertainty estimation have resulted in an increasing number of methods, a rigorous empirical evaluation of their performance on large-scale digital pathology datasets is lacking. This work provides a benchmark for evaluating prevalent methods on multiple datasets by comparing the uncertainty estimates on both in-distribution and realistic near and far out-of-distribution (OOD) data on a whole-slide level. To this end, we aggregate uncertainty values from patch-based classifiers to whole-slide level uncertainty scores. We show that results found in classical computer vision benchmarks do not always translate to the medical imaging setting. Specifically, we demonstrate that deep ensembles perform best at detecting far-OOD data but can be outperformed on a more challenging near-OOD detection task by multi-head ensembles trained for optimal ensemble diversity. Furthermore, we demonstrate the harmful impact OOD data can have on the performance of deployed machine learning models. Overall, we show that uncertainty estimates can be used to discriminate in-distribution from OOD data with high AUC scores. Still, model deployment might require careful tuning based on prior knowledge of prospective OOD data. © 2022 The Author(s)",Deep learning; Ensemble diversity; Histopathology; Multi-heads; Out-of-distribution detection; Uncertainty estimation,Article,Scopus

Convective heat transfer can be enhanced by using vortex generators where, however, the disadvantage of increased mechanical loss due to increased pressure drop is not avoidable. In order to compensate for the penalty, the present study utilizes the characteristics of self-sustained flapping motions of the flexible vortex generator to improve heat transfer without much increasing the pressure drop. The two flexible vortex generators (FVGs) fixed on the upper and lower channel walls, respectively, are introduced in the present study and they take the form of asymmetric configurations by adjusting the inclination angles. The heat transfer performance is observed to depend on the parametric conditions of FVGs such as the inclination angle, bending rigidity, and the gap distance between them. The present system including the asymmetric FVGs shows the improvement of thermal performance by 122% as compared to the baseline flow when the bending rigidity is 0.06, the initial inclination angle is 75°, and the gap distance is 2.4 times the length of FVGs. The attracting Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) are visualized by calculating the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) field to analyze the effects of the vortex structures near the heated channel walls on the fluid mixing. The net energy loss and average heat transfer are predicted by the three machine learning algorithms, i.e., artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest (RF), where the inclination angle, bending rigidity, and gap distance of FVGs are selected as input data. The SVR and ANN algorithms show the best performance in predicting the mean energy loss and the heat transfer, respectively, with the R2 value of above 0.99 and 0.95. © 2022",Enhancement of heat transfer; Flexible vortex generator; Immersed boundary method,Article,Scopus

Understanding the spatial, interannual and long-term variations in nutrient loadings and associated drivers at the national scale is crucial for developing effective nutrient reduction strategies. However, the controls on, and spatiotemporal variations in, nutrient fluxes remain a problem from both an academic and management perspective. This study provides spatially extensive and temporally contiguous estimates of changes in riverine total nitrogen (TN), ammonia nitrogen (NH3–N) and total phosphorus (TP) fluxes for continental area of China based on machine learning stack models and empirical modeling over the period from 1980 to 2018. Results reveal considerable spatial, interannual and long-term variability in annual TN, NH3–N and TP fluxes, with spatial variations in average TN and NH3–N fluxes primarily driven by net anthropogenic nitrogen inputs. Interannual variability is dominated by precipitation across continental areas of China. Spatial variability in the estimated average annual TP flux in the undeveloped western and the developed middle east regions of China are primarily controlled by net anthropogenic phosphorus inputs and precipitation, respectively. We found that TN, NH3–N and TP fluxes increased from 1980 to 2018 in watersheds in East China; the national mean annual TN, NH3–N and TP fluxes increased before 2015 and decreased after 2015. This study illustrates the important role of precipitation and temperature variability in controlling the spatial, interannual and long-term variability of nutrient fluxes, and indicates that the influence of the meteorological conditions on annual loadings is needed when designing watershed nutrient reduction or management strategies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Climate variability; Interannual variability; Long-term variability; Nutrient loading,Article,Scopus

Using DeepLabCut, we introduce and evaluate a machine learning based workflow to track small-bodied fish in order to facilitate improved fish passage management. We specifically studied the behaviour and kinematics of Galaxias maculatus, a widespread diadromous Southern Hemisphere fish species. Upstream fish passage was studied in the presence of three different patches of spoiler baffles at an average water velocity of 0.4 m/s. In semi-supervised mode, the fish locations were extracted, and fish behaviour, such as swimming pathways and resting locations, was analysed based on extracted positions and recorded kinematic parameters. Individual fish behaviour and kinematic parameters were then used to assess the suitability of the three different spoiler baffle designs for enhancing fish passage. Using this technique, we were able to demonstrate where different spoiler baffle configurations resulted in significant differences in fish passage success and behaviour. For example, medium-spaced smaller baffles provided more accessible and uniform resting locations, which were required for efficient upstream passage.

Looking at the effect of AOO on symptomatology may improve clinical outcomes. This study aims to examine whether and how AOO affects symptomatology using a machine learning approach and latent profile analysis (LPA). Methods: The study enrolled 915 participants diagnosed with MDD from eight hospitals across China. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The relationship between symptom profiles and AOO was explored using Random Forest. The effect of AOO on symptom clusters and subtypes was investigated using multiple linear regression and LPA. A continuous AOO indicator was used to conduct the analyses. Results: Based on the Random Forest, symptom profiles were closely associated with AOO. The regression model showed that the severity of neurovegetative symptoms was positively associated with AOO (? = 0.18, p < 0.001), and the severity of cognitive-behavioral symptoms was negatively associated with AOO (? = ?0.12, p < 0.001). LPA demonstrated that the subgroups characterized by suicide and guilt had earlier onset of depression. The subgroup with the lowest global severity of depression had the latest onset. Limitations: AOO was recalled retrospectively. The relative scarcity of participants with childhood and adolescence onset depression. Conclusions: AOO has an important impact on symptomatology.

Many machine learning models have developed to discover the prediction of Alzheimer’s disease, but they are constrained with imbalanced medical dataset with the disease case records. Thus, this paper concentrates on developing the robust model which handles the imbalanced data when there are a smaller number of instances with case label of dementia. In this work, neuro fuzzy symbolic reasoning is developed by adapting case-based reasoning to retrieve similar pattern of matched records with the new instance as input query to determine whether it suffers from dementia or not. The case-based reasoning is empowered by applying cuckoo search model, which involves searching for matching records by applying levy flight strategy to define unknown instances and their corresponding matching instance labels, and this information is given as input to the fuzzy artificial neural network along with training dataset to enhance its prediction accuracy. The FANN with the additional knowledge obtained from cuckoo search-enhanced case-based reasoning during training phase handles uncertainty and produces more accurate results for Alzheimer’s prediction compared to the other traditional models of classification. During testing phase, the new cases are predicted and if the output is correct, then it is added and maintained in the case history for future references. The simulation results proved the prominence of cuckoo search-enabled symbolic reasoning-based Fuzzy Neuro Classifier by applying this strategy on ADNI dataset. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",ADNI; Alzheimer’s disease; Case-based reasoning; Cuckoo search; Fuzzy neuro classifier; Symbolic reasoning,Book Chapter,Scopus

The study applies statistical methods and supervised machine learning algorithm (i.e., logistic regression model) on the large data set of 1300 water samples from the Lahore district of Punjab, Pakistan. All the water samples were collected by the local authorities from a deep unconfined aquifer (&gt; 350 ft in depth) for the years of 2005 to 2016. The characterization of groundwater quality parameters includes pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), total hardness (TH), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl?), bicarbonate (HCO3?), nitrate (NO3?), and sulfate (SO42?). The results show the sequence of the major ion in the following order: Na+ &gt; Ca2+ &gt; Mg+ &gt; K+ and HCO32? &gt; SO42? &gt; Cl? &gt; NO3?. The ionic ratios and Gibb’s plot revealed that the prominent hydrogeochemical facies of aquifer water is Ca–HCO3, Ca–Na–HCO3, and mixed Ca–Mg–Cl type rock-weathering process, especially carbonate and silicate weathering, as significant process controlling water chemistry. The statistical evaluation of the prepared regression model determined its prediction accuracy as 92.2%, which means the model is highly efficient and satisfies the analysis.

The most important cyclostationary features used for network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are then detected with a feature extractor algorithm, such as Boruta and principal component analysis (PCA). These feature patterns are classified to determine the most cyclostationary ones. In particular, this article shows the relevance of detecting cyclostationary malware for a NIDS by using legacy datasets, such as the KDD99 and NSL-KDD. This research has also used the UGRansome cyclostationary dataset intended to support research on anomaly detection. This dataset is subdivided into normal and abnormal classes of network threats. A comparative analysis based on random forest and support vector machine algorithms is undertaken, and the performance of Boruta and PCA was also evaluated. The research suggests the utilization of PCA in terms of extracting cyclostationary network feature patterns as a viable proposition compared to Boruta. The Internet Protocol (IP), malware financial damages, class C of IP addresses, and signature malware were also found to be the most cyclostationary feature pattern. The UGRansome dataset outperformed the KDD99 and NSL-KDD in terms of detecting signature malware with an accuracy of 99% using the random forest algorithm, while the support vector machine achieved 68%. This research proposes the UGRansome as a suitable choice to reduce the computational time of cyclostationary malware classification. Lastly, the research suggests the utilization of random forest to stratify and detect cyclostationary malware. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Anomaly detection; Boruta; Cyclostationarity; Data science; Feature extraction; Machine learning; UGRansome; Z-score; Zero-day threats,Book Chapter,Scopus

In the extremes, mechanistic models can include highly detailed descriptions of a small number of metabolic reactions or an approximate representation of an entire metabolic network. To date, all mechanistic models have required details of individual metabolic reactions, either kinetic parameters or metabolic flux, as well as information about extracellular and intracellular metabolite concentrations. Despite the extensive efforts and the increasing availability of high-quality data, required in vivo data are not available for the majority of known metabolic reactions; thus, mechanistic models are based primarily on ex vivo kinetic measurements and limited flux information. Machine learning approaches provide an alternative for derivation of functional dependencies from existing data. The increasing availability of metabolomic and lipidomic data, with growing feature coverage as well as sample set size, is expected to provide new data options needed for derivation of machine learning models of cell metabolic processes. Moreover, machine learning analysis of longitudinal data can lead to predictive models of cell behaviors over time. Conversely, machine learning models trained on steady-state data can provide descriptive models for the comparison of metabolic states in different environments or disease conditions. Additionally, inclusion of metabolic network knowledge in these analyses can further help in the development of models with limited data. This chapter will explore the application of machine learning to the modeling of cell metabolism. We first provide a theoretical explanation of several machine learning and hybrid mechanistic machine learning methods currently being explored to model metabolism.

As a result, degradation modeling and prediction of mechatronic systems are quite challenging especially when highly integrative and special operational conditions are considered. To overcome such challenges, artificial neural networks can be employed. This paper proposes the use of a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based multi-input neural network for degradation modeling and prediction of an Electro-Hydrostatic Actuator (EHA) system. The failure mechanisms of the EHA system are explored first, and the obtained physics-of-failure information is utilized in constructing the LSTM neural network to enhance the prediction capability of the model. An actual dataset collected from an EHA test bench is utilized to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed physics-informed LSTM method for modeling the EHA system's degradation behavior.

In the Industry 4.0 environment, large-scale high-dimensional monitoring data features the complex pattern of high level semantics. In order to provide enterprise-wide monitoring solutions, it is necessary to identify the high-level semantic patterns of the anomalies in these data without splitting them. Existing end-to-end deep neural networks for time series are capable of recognizing the high-level semantics in natural language or speech signals, but they are barely applied in real-time anomaly detection of industrial data because of the large time costs. In this paper, we leverage the self-supervised contrastive learning methodology and propose a Composite Semantic Augmentation Encoder (CSAE) to provide an appropriate representation of industrial data and implement quick detection of anomalies in industrial application environments. CSAE is a non-sequential deep neural network with two augmentation layers and a mandatory layer. The two layers of data-augmentation are built to expand the size of samples of both low-level semantic anomalies and high-level semantic anomalies, which enables CSAE to discover diverse anomalies and improves its accuracy of high-level semantic pattern recognition. The mandatory layer is built to compress and reserve the temporal information in the industrial data to accelerate the anomaly detection. Therefore, as a non-sequential contrastive learning model, CSAE has faster training convergence than the usual sequence models. The experiment results have verified that CSAE can achieve higher prediction accuracy with less time consumption than existing machine learning models in the tasks of high dimensional anomaly pattern detection. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Anomaly detection; Data augmentation; Industrial data,Article,Scopus

Recently, the connectional brain template (CBT) was introduced as a compact representation integrating a population of brain multigraphs, where two brain regions can have multiple connections, into a single graph. Given a population of brain multigraphs observed at a baseline timepoint t1, we aim to learn how to predict the evolution of the population CBT at follow-up timepoints t&gt;t1. Such model will allow us to foresee the evolution of the connectivity patterns of healthy and disordered individuals at the population level. Here we present recurrent multigraph integrator network (ReMI-Net?) to forecast population templates at consecutive timepoints from a given single timepoint. In particular, we unprecedentedly design a graph neural network architecture to model the changes in the brain multigraph and identify the biomarkers that differentiate between the typical and atypical populations. Addressing such issues is of paramount importance in diagnosing neurodegenerative disorders at early stages and promoting new clinical studies based on the pinned-down biomarker brain regions or connectivities. In this paper, we demonstrate the design and use of the ReMI-Net? model, which learns both the multigraph node level and time level dependencies concurrently. Thanks to its novel graph convolutional design and normalization layers, ReMI-Net? predicts well-centered, discriminative, and topologically sound connectional templates over time. Additionally, the results show that our model outperforms all benchmarks and state-of-the-art methods by comparing and discovering the atypical connectivity alterations over time.

Although UDA is typically jointly trained on data from both domains, accessing the labeled source domain data is often restricted, due to concerns over patient data privacy or intellectual property. To sidestep this, we propose “off-the-shelf (OS)” UDA (OSUDA), aimed at image segmentation, by adapting an OS segmentor trained in a source domain to a target domain, in the absence of source domain data in adaptation. Toward this goal, we aim to develop a novel batch-wise normalization (BN) statistics adaptation framework. In particular, we gradually adapt the domain-specific low-order BN statistics, e.g., mean and variance, through an exponential momentum decay strategy, while explicitly enforcing the consistency of the domain shareable high-order BN statistics, e.g., scaling and shifting factors, via our optimization objective. We also adaptively quantify the channel-wise transferability to gauge the importance of each channel, via both low-order statistics divergence and a scaling factor. Furthermore, we incorporate unsupervised self-entropy minimization into our framework to boost performance alongside a novel queued, memory-consistent self-training strategy to utilize the reliable pseudo label for stable and efficient unsupervised adaptation. We evaluated our OSUDA-based framework on both cross-modality and cross-subtype brain tumor segmentation and cardiac MR to CT segmentation tasks. Our experimental results showed that our memory consistent OSUDA performs better than existing source-relaxed UDA methods and yields similar performance to UDA methods with source data. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Batch Normalization; Image segmentation; Memory-based learning; Self-training; Unsupervised domain adaptation,Article,Scopus

A representative volume element model is proposed for finite element simulations to explore further the compressive performance, with good agreement achieved between measurements and simulations.

Nevertheless, further research is being conducted to improve existing rehabilitation exoskeletons in terms of ease-of-use and innovative design. Previously, the adaptation of linkage-based mechanisms for rehabilitation exoskeletons has been considered an option. However, finding linkage parameters that will produce the required gait trajectories using a linkage-based exoskeleton, is quite challenging. It is furthermore challenging to obtain parameters of a linkage-based mechanism designed for a gait rehabilitation task that has to produce two trajectories (for knee and ankle joints) simultaneously.

The proposed methodology demonstrates high efficacy in determining the linkage parameters for various target trajectories. The proposed framework, once trained, can accurately predict mechanism parameters to achieve two joint trajectories simultaneously. Subsequent to developing the model, walking trajectories from healthy human subjects are given to the model to determine the optimal linkage dimensions of the gait rehabilitation exoskeleton.

Content-based WSI retrieval can be a new approach to find highly correlated WSIs in a historically diagnosed WSI archive, which has the potential usages for assisted clinical diagnosis, medical research, and trainee education. During WSI retrieval, it is particularly challenging to encode the semantic content of histopathological images and to measure the similarity between images for interpretable results due to the gigapixel size of WSIs. In this work, we propose a Retrieval with Clustering-guided Contrastive Learning (RetCCL) framework for robust and accurate WSI-level image retrieval, which integrates a novel self-supervised feature learning method and a global ranking and aggregation algorithm for much improved performance. The proposed feature learning method makes use of existing large-scale unlabeled histopathological image data, which helps learn universal features that could be used directly for subsequent WSI retrieval tasks without extra fine-tuning. The proposed WSI retrieval method not only returns a set of WSIs similar to a query WSI, but also highlights patches or sub-regions of each WSI that share high similarity with patches of the query WSI, which helps pathologists interpret the searching results. Our WSI retrieval framework has been evaluated on the tasks of anatomical site retrieval and cancer subtype retrieval using over 22,000 slides, and the performance exceeds other state-of-the-art methods significantly (around 10% for the anatomic site retrieval in terms of average mMV@10). Besides, the patch retrieval using our learned feature representation offers a performance improvement of 24% on the TissueNet dataset in terms of mMV@5 compared with using ImageNet pre-trained features, which further demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed CCL feature learning method. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Feature extraction; Histopathology; Image retrieval; Self-supervised learning,Article,Scopus

However, detecting and analyzing the pattern of outliers can contribute to future business decisions or increase the accuracy of a learning algorithm. Selecting the applicable outlier detection method for a dataset requires human intervention and analysis due to the challenge of choosing an efficient technique suitable for all types of attributes. This work presents a procedure for anomaly detection and analysis. The procedure is feature-wise (i.e., processes each feature independently), uses T different anomaly detection techniques (for T>1), and estimates the best technique using predefined thresholds. It is a generic method that does not depend on the model type and can be applied to supervised and unsupervised learning. In addition, this method does not impute or remove the outliers, as they should be adapted according to the dataset or business requirements. The significant advantage of this method is the ability to use different techniques to detect anomalies since it is applied per feature and not per record, as in traditional anomaly detection methods. Furthermore, the method uses a new measure, Noise Ratio (NR), which describes the level of agreement between our method's result and traditional anomaly detection techniques. The results showed that all the compared techniques identified non-anomalous features with consistent results between the various algorithms.

Typically, numerical data are used for the long-term correlation that is required for estimating the yield of new wind farm projects. However, VMMs can also be used to fill data gaps or during the operational phase as an additional reference data set to detect degrading sensors. The value of a VMM directly depends on its ability and precision to reproduce site-specific environmental conditions. Commonly, linear regression is used as state of the art to correct reference data to the site-specific conditions.

The chamber has a total of seven gas gaps, where the first and last gas gaps are displaced by ?1.5 m. Each gas gap has 50 channels with a size of 18–20 mm. Two neural network models are developed and presented: a convolutional neural network and a neural network optimized for the detector configuration of this study. In the latter network, a convolution layer is provided for each of three groups formed from 2–3 gas gaps of the chamber, and the outputs are fed into multilayer perceptrons in sequence. Both networks are transformed into hardware description language and implemented in Virtex UltraScale+ FPGA.

Most deep learning-based computational methods either develop unique chemical representation or combine complex model. However, researchers are less concerned with the possible advantages of enormous quantities of unlabeled molecular data. Since the obvious limited amount of labeled data available, this task becomes more difficult. In some senses, SMILES of the drug molecule may be regarded of as a language for chemistry, taking inspiration from natural language processing research and current advances in pretrained models. In this paper, we incorporated Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE) efficiently encode the position information of SMILES sequences, ultimately enhancing the capability of the BERT pretrained model to extract potential molecular substructure information for molecular property prediction. We proposed the MolRoPE-BERT framework, an new end-to-end deep learning framework that integrates an efficient position coding approach for capturing sequence position information with a pretrained BERT model for molecular property prediction. To generate useful molecular substructure embeddings, we first exclusively train the MolRoPE-BERT on four million unlabeled drug SMILES(i.e., ZINC 15 and ChEMBL 27).

The massive increase in computational capacity and speed of quantum computers can lead to a quantum leap in the healthcare field. Heart disease seriously threatens human health since it is the leading cause of death worldwide. Quantum machine learning methods can propose effective solutions to predict heart disease and aid in early diagnosis. In this study, an ensemble machine learning model based on quantum machine learning classifiers is proposed to predict the risk of heart disease. The proposed model is a bagging ensemble learning model where a quantum support vector classifier was used as a base classifier. Furthermore, in order to make the model’s outcomes more explainable, the importance of every single feature in the prediction is computed and visualized using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework. In the experimental study, other standalone quantum classifiers, namely, Quantum Support Vector Classifier (QSVC), Quantum Neural Network (QNN), and Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) are applied and compared with classical machine learning classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The experimental results on the Cleveland dataset reveal the superiority of QSVC compared to the others, which explains its use in the proposed bagging model. The Bagging- QSVC model outperforms all aforementioned classifiers with an accuracy of 90.16% while showing great competitiveness compared to some state-of-the-art models using the same dataset. The results of the study indicate that quantum machine learning classifiers perform better than classical machine learning classifiers in predicting heart disease. In addition, the study reveals that the bagging ensemble learning technique is effective in improving the prediction accuracy of quantum classifiers. © 2023, Tech Science Press.

This study reviews and describes performance instruments via formally defined novel concepts and clarifies the terminology. The study first highlights the issues in performance evaluation via a survey of 78 mobile-malware classification studies and reviews terminology. Based on three research questions, it proposes novel concepts to identify characteristics, similarities, and differences of instruments that are categorized into ‘performance measures’ and ‘performance metrics’ in the classification context for the first time. The concepts reflecting the intrinsic properties of instruments such as canonical form, geometry, duality, complementation, dependency, and leveling, aim to reveal similarities and differences of numerous instruments, such as redundancy and ground-truth versus prediction focuses. As an application of knowledge representation, we introduced a new exploratory table called PToPI (Periodic Table of Performance Instruments) for 29 measures and 28 metrics (69 instruments including variant and parametric ones). Visualizing proposed concepts, PToPI provides a new relational structure for the instruments including graphical, probabilistic, and entropic ones to see their properties and dependencies all in one place. Applications of the exploratory table in six examples from different domains in the literature have shown that PToPI aids overall instrument analysis and selection of the proper performance metrics according to the specific requirements of a classification problem. We expect that the proposed concepts and PToPI will help researchers comprehend and use the instruments and follow a systematic approach to classification performance evaluation and publication. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Classification; Knowledge representation; Machine learning; Performance evaluation; Performance measures; Performance metrics; Periodic table,Article,Scopus

A standard approach is to find the globally best modeling method from a set of candidate methods. However, it is perhaps rare in reality that one candidate method is uniformly better than the others. A natural approach for this scenario is to apply a weighted L2 loss in performance assessment to reflect the region-specific interest. We propose a targeted cross-validation (TCV) to select models or procedures based on a general weighted L2 loss. We show that the TCV is consistent in selecting the best performing candidate under the weighted L2 loss. Experimental studies are used to demonstrate the use of TCV and its potential advantage over the global CV or the approach of using only local data for modeling a local region. Previous investigations on CV have relied on the condition that when the sample size is large enough, the ranking of two candidates stays the same. However, in many applications with the setup of changing data-generating processes or highly adaptive modeling methods, the relative performance of the methods is not static as the sample size varies. Even with a fixed data-generating process, it is possible that the ranking of two methods switches infinitely many times. In this work, we broaden the concept of the selection consistency by allowing the best candidate to switch as the sample size varies, and then establish the consistency of the TCV. This flexible framework can be applied to high-dimensional and complex machine learning scenarios where the relative performances of modeling procedures are dynamic. © 2023 ISI/BS.",Consistency; cross-validation; model selection; regression,Article,Scopus

Several kinds of external knowledge, such as text and attribute, have been widely investigated, but they alone are limited with incomplete semantics. Some very recent studies thus propose to use Knowledge Graph (KG) due to its high expressivity and compatibility for representing kinds of knowledge. However, the ZSL community is still in short of standard benchmarks for studying and comparing different external knowledge settings and different KG-based ZSL methods. In this paper, we proposed six resources covering three tasks, i.e., zero-shot image classification (ZS-IMGC), zero-shot relation extraction (ZS-RE), and zero-shot KG completion (ZS-KGC). Each resource has a normal ZSL benchmark and a KG containing semantics ranging from text to attribute, from relational knowledge to logical expressions. We have clearly presented these resources including their construction, statistics, data formats and usage cases w.r.t. different ZSL methods. More importantly, we have conducted a comprehensive benchmarking study, with a few classic and state-of-the-art methods for each task, including a method with KG augmented explanation. We discussed and compared different ZSL paradigms w.r.t. different external knowledge settings, and found that our resources have great potential for developing more advanced ZSL methods and more solutions for applying KGs for augmenting machine learning.

The study of metabolomic pathways, together with protein engineering, may also aid in the extraction, at a scale, of natural products to be used as drugs and drug precursors. Several approaches have been used to correlate protein annotations to metabolic pathways in order to derive pathways directly related to specific organisms. These could range from association rule-mining techniques to machine learning methods such as decision trees, naïve Bayes, logistic regression, and ensemble methods. In this chapter, we will be reviewing the use of machine learning for metabolic pathway analyses, with a step-by-step focus on the use of deep learning to predict the association of compounds (metabolites) to their respective metabolomic pathway classes. This prediction could help explain interactions of small molecules in organisms. Inspired by the work of Baranwal et al. (2019), we demonstrate how to build and train a deep learning neural network model to perform a multi-label prediction. We considered two different types of fingerprints as features (inputs to the model). The output of the model is the set of metabolic pathway classes (from the KEGG dataset) in which the input molecule participates. We will walk through the various steps of this process, including data collection, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation.

Calf posture recognition is one of the effective methods to monitor calf behaviour and health state, which can be achieved by monitoring the calf behaviours of standing and lying where the former depicts active calf, and the latter, passive calf. Calf posture recognition module is an important component of some automated calf monitoring systems, as the system requires the calf to be in a standing posture before proceeding to the next stage of monitoring, or at the very least, to monitor the activeness of the calves. Calf posture such as standing or resting can easily be distinguished by human eye, however, to be recognized by a machine, it will require more complicated frameworks, particularly one that involves a deep learning neural networks model. Large number of high-quality images are required to train a deep learning model for such tasks. In this paper, multiple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures were compared, and the residual network (ResNet) model (specifically, ResNet-50) was ultimately chosen due to its simplicity, great performance, and decent inference time. Two ResNet-50 models having the exact same architecture and configuration have been trained on two different image datasets respectively sourced by separate cameras placed at different angle. There were two camera placements to use for comparison because camera placements can significantly impact the quality of the images, which is highly correlated to the deep learning model performance.

To efficiently analyze the response of structures equipped with quantum wells, we propose using an artificial neural network trained with the results from the solution of Schrödinger's equation. We observe an impressive agreement between the predicted quantum well's eigenenergies and effective masses, in comparison to the results obtained from the iterative solution of the Schrödinger equation, for an extensive range of structures.

Then, the influence of column parameters (such as fundamental period and longitudinal reinforcement ratio) and pulse parameters (such as pulse period and peak pulse velocity) on NFPSDS is quantitatively investigated. Thus, by employing the NFPSDS method, the reasonable design range of longitudinal reinforcement ratio can be obtained under different pulse periods and pulse velocities.

Publications covering deep learning to power quality are stratified in terms of application, type of data, and learning technique. This work shows that the majority of the deep learning applications to power quality are based on unrealistic synthetic data and supervised learning without proper labelling. Some applications with deep learning have already been solved by previous machine learning methods or expert systems. The main barriers to implementing deep learning to power quality are related to lack of novelty, low transparency of the deep learning methods, and lack of benchmark databases. This work also discusses that even with automatic feature extraction by deep learning methods, power quality expert knowledge is still needed to implement and analyse the results. The main research gaps identified in this work are related to the applications of semi-supervised learning, explainable deep learning and hybrid approaches combining deep learning with expert systems. Suggestions for overcoming the present limitations are: providing a stronger collaboration among the grid stakeholders and academy to keep track of power quality events; proper labelling and enlarging of datasets in deep learning methods; explaining the end-to-end decision making of deep learning methods; providing open-access databases for comparison purposes. © 2022 The Author(s)",Artificial intelligence; Data analysis; Deep learning; Machine learning; Power quality,Review,Scopus

Predicting the seismic limit-state capacity of steel Moment-Resisting Frames (MRFs) can help designers to have a preliminary estimation and improve their views about the seismic performance of the designed structure. This study improved data-driven decision techniques in Python software, known as supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, to find median IDA curves (M-IDAs) for predicting the seismic limit-state capacities of steel MRFs considering Soil-Structure Interaction (SSI) effects. For this purpose, Incremental Dynamic Analyses (IDAs) were performed on the steel MRFs from two to nine-story elevations modeled in Opensees subjected to three ground motion subsets of Far Fault (FF), near-fault Pulse-Like (PL) and No-Pulse (NP) suggested by FEMA-P695. The result of the analysis confirmed that there is no specific model for predicting the M-IDA curve of steel structures; therefore, the best developed ML algorithms to reduce a complex modeling process with high computational cost using 128,000 data points were proposed.

Establishing a prediction model is usually an effective method to solve this critical problem. The type of TBM penetration rate prediction models can be divided into two categories: theoretical models and empirical models. Each model has its advantages, but there are also shortcomings. To make the advantages of the two models complement each other and further improve the accuracy and application scope of the prediction model, this paper proposes a prediction ensemble model of PR based on a full-scale linear cutting test and machine learning algorithm. A semi-theoretical TBM penetration rate prediction model is established through the full-scale linear cutting test and the rock-breaking analysis of granite and sandstone with different strengths. Based on the XGBoost intelligent algorithm, an empirical model of the penetration rate prediction is also established. On this basis, the Bagging algorithm combines these two models to form an ensemble prediction model of TBM penetration rate. We collected rock mass and operational parameters in the Hangzhou Second Water Source Water Transfer Channel Project to verify the semi-theoretical, empirical, and ensemble models, respectively. The results show that the three models' prediction errors are all less than 15%, and the ensemble model has a smaller error of 10.2%.

However, since FL can still leak the user’s original data by exchanging gradient information. The existing privacy protection strategy will increase the uplink time due to encryption measures. It is a huge challenge in terms of communication. When there are a large number of devices, the privacy protection cost of the system is higher. Based on these issues, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme of user-based group collaborative federated learning (GrCol-PPFL). Our scheme primarily divides participants into several groups and each group communicates in a chained transmission mechanism. All groups work in parallel at the same time. The server distributes a random parameter with the same dimension as the model parameter for each participant as a mask for the model parameter. We use the public datasets of modified national institute of standards and technology database (MNIST) to test the model accuracy. The experimental results show that GrCol-PPFL not only ensures the accuracy of the model, but also ensures the security of the user’s original data when users collude with each other. Finally, through numerical experiments, we show that by changing the number of groups, we can find the optimal number of groups that reduces the uplink consumption time. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

In this paper, an improved Term Weighting technique combined with Parts-Of-Speech (POS) Tagging is proposed to reduce dimensions for automatic and effective classification of clinical text related to Covid-19 disease. Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is the most often used term weighting scheme (TWS). However, TF-IDF has several developments to improve its drawbacks, in particular, it is not efficient enough to classify text by assigning effective weights to the terms in unstructured data. In this research, we proposed a modification term weighting scheme: RTF-C-IEF and compare the proposed model with four extraction methods: TF, TF-IDF, TF-IHF, and TF-IEF. The experiment was conducted on two new datasets for COVID-19 patients. The first dataset was collected from government hospitals in Iraq with 3053 clinical records, and the second dataset with 1446 clinical reports, was collected from several different websites. Based on the experimental results using several popular classifiers applied to the datasets of Covid-19, we observe that the proposed scheme RTF-C-IEF achieves is a consistent performer with the best scores in most of the experiments. Further, the modified RTF-C-IEF proposed in the study outperformed the original scheme and other employed term weighting methods in most experiments. Thus, the proper selection of term weighting scheme among the different methods improves the performance of the classifier and helps to find the informative term. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

Instead of a manual inspection, various automated systems are invented to satisfy the need, including the classification of light curve profiles. A specific Kaggle competition, namely Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC), is launched to gather new ideas of tackling the abovementioned task using the data set collected from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) project. Almost all proposed methods fall into the supervised family with a common aim to categorize each object into one of pre-defined types. As this challenge focuses on developing a predictive model that is robust to classifying unseen data, those previous attempts similarly encounter the lack of discriminate features, since distribution of training and actual test datasets are largely different. As a result, well-known classification algorithms prove to be sub-optimal, while more complicated feature extraction techniques may help to slightly boost the predictive performance. Given such a burden, this research is set to explore an unsupervised alternative to the difficult quest, where common classifiers fail to reach the 50% accuracy mark. A clustering technique is exploited to transform the space of training data, from which a more accurate classifier can be built. In addition to a single clustering framework that provides a comparable accuracy to the front runners of supervised learning, a multiple-clustering alternative is also introduced with improved performance. In fact, it is able to yield a higher accuracy rate of 58.32% from 51.36% that is obtained using a simple clustering.

Aiming at the difficulties faced by the existing automated dark web traffic analysis methods, a novel method named Dark-Forest to analyze the behavior of dark web traffic is proposed. In this method, firstly, particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to filter the redundant features of dark web traffic data, which can effectively shorten the training and inference time of the model to meet the realtime requirements of dark web detection task. Then, the selected features of traffic are analyzed and classified using the DeepForest model as a backbone classifier.

The traffic control and data forwarding functions are decoupled in software-defined networking (SDN) and allow the network to be programmable. Each switch in SDN keeps track of forwarding information in a flow table. The SDN switches must search the flow table for the flow rules that match the packets to handle the incoming packets. Due to the obvious vast quantity of data in data centres, the capacity of the flow table restricts the data plane’s forwarding capabilities. So, the SDN must handle traffic from across the whole network. The flow table depends on Ternary Content Addressable Memorable Memory (TCAM) for storing and a quick search of regulations; it is restricted in capacity owing to its elevated cost and energy consumption. Whenever the flow table is abused and overflowing, the usual regulations cannot be executed quickly. In this case, we consider low-rate flow table overflowing that causes collision flow rules to be installed and consumes excessive existing flow table capacity by delivering packets that don’t fit the flow table at a low rate. This study introduces machine learning techniques for detecting and categorizing low-rate collision flows table in SDN, using Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN), K-Means, and Decision Tree (DT). We generate two network topologies, Fat Tree and Simple Tree Topologies, with the Mininet simulator and coupled to the OpenDayLight (ODL) controller. The efficiency and efficacy of the suggested algorithms are assessed using several assessment indicators such as success rate query, propagation delay, overall dropped packets, energy consumption, bandwidth usage, latency rate, and throughput. The findings showed that the suggested technique to tackle the flow table congestion problem minimizes the number of flows while retaining the statistical consistency of the 5G network. By putting the proposed flow method and checking whether a packet may move from point A to point B without breaking certain regulations, the evaluation tool examines every flow against a set of criteria. The FFNN with DT and K-means algorithms obtain accuracies of 96.29% and 97.51%, respectively, in the identification of collision flows, according to the experimental outcome when associated with existing methods from the literature. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

In addition, we treat seismic attributes as geologic constraints and feed them into the network along with the seismic cubes. These different seismic and multiattribute cubes from the same position are regarded as positive pairs and the cubes from a different position are treated as negative pairs. A contrastive learning framework is used to maximize the similarities of positive pairs and minimize the similarities of negative pairs. In this way, we can enforce the samples with similar features to get close while pushing the samples with different features to be separated in the space where we make the seismic facies clustering.

Advanced IoT device characteristics are mainly to blame for the wide range of applications that may now be achieved with IoT devices. Corporations have begun to embrace the IoT concept. Identifying true and suitable devices, security faults that might be used for bad reasons, and administration of such devices are only a few of the issues that IoT, a new concept in technological progress, provides. In some ways, IoT device traffic differs from regular device traffic. Devices with particular features can be classified into categories, irrespective of their function or performance. Ever-changing and complex environments, like a smart home, demand this classification scheme. A total of 41 IoT devices were employed in this investigation. To build a multiclass classification model, IoT devices contributed 13 network traffic parameters. To further preprocess the raw data received, preprocessing techniques like Normalization and Dataset Scaling were utilized. Feature engineering techniques can extract features from the text data. A total of 117,423 feature vectors are contained in the dataset after stratification, which are used to further improve the classification model. In this study, a variety of performance indicators were employed to show the performance of the logiboosted algorithms. Logi-XGB scored 80.2% accuracy following application of the logit-boosted algorithms to the dataset for classification, whereas Logi-GBC achieved 77.8% accuracy. Meanwhile, Logi-ABC attained 80.7% accuracy. Logi-CBC, on the other hand, received the highest Accuracy score of 85.6%. The accuracy of Logi-LGBM and Logi-HGBC was the same at 81.37% each. Our suggested Logi-CBC showed the highest accuracy on the dataset when compared to existing Logit-Boosted Algorithms used in earlier studies. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

Twenty references including 9252 data points were collected to form four different models: linear, support vector machine (SVM), boosted tree (BT), and artificial neural network (ANN). Among the four models, BT exhibited optimal prediction accuracy in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) values for membrane RP (RMSE: 0.295, R2: 0.918) and RS (RMSE: 0.053, R2: 0.849) performance prediction. Parameter contribution analysis indicated that nanoparticle loading, amine concentration, chloride concentration, water contact angle, solvent viscosity, and molar volume are the main parameters influencing RP performance. For RS performance, nanoparticle loading, amine concentration, chloride concentration, and solute molecular weight play important roles. Partial dependence analysis indicated that the optimal conditions for TFN-OSN membrane fabrication are nanoparticle loading less than 5 wt%, the amine concentration around 2 wt%, and the chloride concentration around 0.15 wt%. In addition, membrane with super-hydrophilic or super-hydrophobic surface property exhibited higher RP performance based on different feed solvent types. Overall, this work introduces new ways both for TFN-OSN membrane performance prediction and for higher performance membrane design and development. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Boosted tree model; Machine learning; Organic solvent nanofiltration; Relative permeability; Relative selectivity; Thin film nanocomposite membrane,Article,Scopus

However, past research has tended to discuss these two factors separately, which might lead to inconsistency. This study addresses this gap by examining the importance of each predictor of aggression in a Chinese compulsory drug treatment population and further explores the predictors of aggression in various substance use disorder populations. Method: Analyses were conducted using a sample of 894 male participants (mean = 38.30, SD = 8.38) in Chinese compulsory drug rehab. A machine learning model named LightGBM was employed to make predictions. We then used a game-theoretic explanatory technique, SHAP, to estimate the effect of predictors. Results: In the full-sample model, psychological security, parental conflict, and impulsivity were the top 3 predictors. Depression, childhood abuse, and alexithymia positively predicted aggression, whereas psychological security, family cohesion, and gratitude negatively predicted aggression. There were significant differences in the predictive effects of depressants and stimulants. Although the importance of predictors varied between drug-use groups, several individual and situational factors were consistently the most important predictors. Limitations: All participants in this study were male, and the data were acquired through self-reports from the participants. Domestic and nondomestic aggression are not distinguished. Additionally, our findings cannot support causal conclusions. Conclusion: This study tested a series of classical theories of the predictors of aggression in China's compulsory drug treatment context and extended the ideas of the GAM to various substance use disorder groups. The findings have important implications for aggression treatment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Aggression; GAM model; Individual and situational factors; Machine learning approach; Substance addiction,Article,Scopus

We aimed to explore the mechanisms of cognitive impairments among patients with MDD by investigating the dynamics of overlapping brain sub-networks. Methods: Forty unmedicated patients with MDD and 28 healthy controls (HC) were enrolled in this study. Cognitive function was measured using the Chinese versions of MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). All participants were scanned using a whole-head resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) machine. The dynamism of neural sub-networks was analyzed based on the detection of overlapping communities in five frequency bands of oscillatory brain signals. Results: MDD demonstrated poorer cognitive performance in six domains compared to HC. The difference in community detection (functional integration mode) in MDD was frequency-dependent. MDD showed significantly decreased community dynamics in all frequency bands compared to HC. Specifically, differences in the visual network (VN) and default mode network (DMN) were detected in all frequency bands, differences in the cognitive control network (CCN) were detected in the alpha2 and beta frequency bands, and differences in the bilateral limbic network (BLN) were only detected in the beta frequency band. Moreover, community dynamics in the alpha2 frequency band were positively correlated with verbal learning and reasoning problem solving abilities in MDD. Conclusions: Our study found that decreasing in the dynamics of overlapping sub-networks may differ by frequency bands. The aberrant dynamics of overlapping neural sub-networks revealed by frequency-specific MEG signals may provide new information on the mechanism of cognitive impairments that result from MDD. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Cognitive function; Dynamic functional connectivity; Magnetoencephalography; Major depressive disorder; Overlapping sub-network,Article,Scopus

Due to the near-exponential rate of initial expansion, the new strain may not be detected at its true geographical origin but in the area with the most favorable conditions leading to the fastest exponential growth. Therefore, it is crucial to understand better the factors that promote such outbursts, which we address in the example of analyzing global Omicron transmissibility during its global emergence/outburst in November 2021–February 2022. As predictors, we assemble a number of potentially relevant factors: vaccinations (both full and boosters), different measures of population mobility (provided by Google), estimated stringency of measures, the prevalence of chronic diseases, population age, the timing of the outburst, and several other socio-demographic variables. As a proxy for natural immunity (prevalence of prior infections in population), we use cumulative numbers of COVID-19 deaths. As a response variable (transmissibility measure), we use the estimated effective reproduction number (Re) averaged in the vicinity of the outburst maxima. To select significant predictors of Re, we use machine learning regressions that employ feature selection, including methods based on ensembles of decision trees (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting). We identify the young population, earlier infection onset, higher mobility, low natural immunity, and low booster prevalence as likely direct risk factors. Interestingly, we find that all these risk factors were significantly higher for Africa, though curiously somewhat lower in Southern African countries (where the outburst emerged) compared to other African countries. Therefore, while the risk factors related to the virus transmissibility clearly promote the outburst of a new virus variant, specific regions/countries where the outburst actually happens may be related to less evident factors, possibly random in nature. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Ecological regressions; Effective reproduction number; Machine learning; Omicron transmissibility; Outburst risk factors,Article,Scopus

Now, flood susceptibility modelling based on data driven model is state-of-the-art method such as ensemble learning and deep learning. However, the effect of deep learning coupling with ensemble learning models in flood susceptibility modelling is still unknown. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose three deep learning coupling with ensemble learning models by combining the deep learning (DL) with Filtered Classifier (FC), Rotation forest (RF) and Random Subspace (RSS) and explore the effect of coupling method for modelling flood susceptibility. The key step of this paper is as following: firstly, a Dingnan County which is lied in the Jiangxi Province of China is chosen as a case study, single flood event point and random sampling method was applied to generate the flood and non-flood data, respectively, then frequency ratio was utilized to analyze the relationship between each influencing factor and flood occurrence, based on the value of VIF, Spearman's correlation and One R classifier, the result show that there is no multicollinearity between each influencing factor, ten influencing factors have contribution to the flood occurrence and all of them are applied to construct the coupling model. Finally, the DL, FC-DL, RF-DL and RSS-DL were applied to produce flood susceptibility maps. Then, several statistical indexes such as area under the curve (AUC), Kappa index, accuracy (ACC), and F-measure were used to assess the accomplishment of these coupling models. For the train data, the FC-DL model acquired the highest AUC value (0.996), followed by RF-DL (0.944), RSS-DL (0.934), and DL (0.934). For the validation data, the result showed that all models have a good accomplishment (AUC>0.8). In a word, the deep learning coupling with ensemble learning models demonstrates the more reliable and excellent performance. Hence, the proposed new method will help the government for land use planning and can be applied in other area around the world. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Coupling models; Deep learning; Ensemble learning; Flood susceptibility modelling,Article,Scopus

Although various imaging devices can provide the inner structure of the rock sample directly, numerical modelling methods still has its irreplaceable advantages. Firstly, due to some intrinsic limitations, no imaging device so far can provide a 3D porous structure satisfying both resolution and field of view except for a very few of homogeneous reservoir samples with relatively large pore-throat size, while numerical modelling is an effective approach to improve the resolution of the machine produced images. Secondly, in some cases, where only 2D images (such as the images of drill cuttings) are available, numerical modelling is the only option to reconstruct a 3D porous structure. Thirdly, numerical modelling is a convenient and low-cost technique that makes it widely applicable. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the pore scale reservoir modelling. Pore structure's modelling can be treated as a supervised prediction process with two steps: 1) extraction of descriptors (prior knowledge) from the training image(s) or laboratory measured data; and 2) numerical reconstruction under the supervision of the extracted descriptors. In terms of extraction of descriptors, using multiple-point statistics (MPS) instead of random function models is a great step that made the empirical multivariate distributions inferred from training images can be directly used to reconstruct porous structure. Another great progress is the application of multiple-resolution training images where the image degradation mechanism contained in these different resolution images can be used to supervise the reconstruction. In terms of supervised reconstruction, some mathematical strategies such as Gaussian Random field, simulated annealing are applied to reproduce these descriptors in the reconstructed images. Along with the flourish of deep learning, a convolutional neural networks model is introduced into reconstruction process with an impressive performance. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Numerical modelling; Porous structure reconstruction; Reservoir characterization,Article,Scopus

In three-way concept analysis, data are analyzed using two types of concept lattices constructed using classical formal concept analysis (FCA) algorithms: object-induced (OE) concept lattices and attribute-induced (AE) concept lattices. The existing formal concept analysis algorithms focus on the sequential generation of OE and AE concepts rather than finding them in parallel and cannot process large datasets efficiently. The main contribution of this paper is that we propose a novel parallel algorithm for concept generation and construction of the three way concept lattice for knowledge discovery and representation in large datasets.

Further we develop an efficient algorithm for OE and AE concept generation and lattice construction. Extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

It is crucial since the industrial structure, living standards, and consumption level are closely related to GDP. In recent years, the Chinese GDP has maintained rapid growth. Admittedly, the contribution of agriculture to GPD is gradually decreasing. As the foundation of life, the structure of agricultural production still needs to be improved. Therefore, this paper applies machine learning skills to investigate how to improve the agricultural production structure to promote GDP. A total of 47 agricultural products were selected and analyzed. We extracted the production data from 1980 to 2018. K-means clustering model was used to group products into several clusters. The Holt-winters model predicts the following year’s production of the different agriculture products to simulate next year’s GDP. The linear regression model quantifies the relationship between clusters and GDP. Based on that relationship, we provide suggestions on stimulating GDP growth. For assessment, both linear regression and neural network models are used to simulate the GDP after considering the recommendations. Results show that the proposed approach offers relevant recommendations to stimulate the Chinese GDP based on the agriculture data. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Agriculture; Decision making; GDP; Holt-winters; K-means clustering; Linear regression; Machine learning; Neural networks,Book Chapter,Scopus

This is due to multiple factors, training of health professionals aimed at curing diseases, lack of quality data, processing capacity, poor multidisciplinary approach, etc. However, this paradigm is changing, focusing on maintaining the health of individuals to avoid diseases, improving social welfare. To achieve this, the new approach proposes that medicine must be Preventive, Participatory, Predictive, and Personalized (P4 Medicine). In this chapter, we will analyze how artificial intelligence can convincingly contribute to the construction of P4 Medicine, through the processing of key data such as DNA, electronic medical records and environmental variables to which people have been exposed. Here we can find complex data such as Computed Tomography images, electroencephalograms, free text in electronic medical records, pharmacological data, etc. These data have grown exponentially and efforts to improve their quality are already paying off. However, it is no longer possible for a health professional to analyze them to provide a better diagnosis or carry out preventive work on diseases, requiring the formation of multidisciplinary teams to find new solutions to ancient problems, such as healthcare, where data processing, knowledge extraction and its subsequent parameterization in support systems for medical decision-making are vital to save lives. In this sense, artificial intelligence, together with new methods for processing complex data and computational resources to process massive data, will be key to improving the humanity health. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Artificial intelligence; Healthcare; Machine learning; P4 medicine,Book Chapter,Scopus

Gait dysfunction or impairment is considered to be one of the most common and devastating physiological consequences of stroke. Active lower extremity rehabilitation can promote the recovery of gait function, improve the ability to perform activities of daily living, and improve the quality of life of patients. OBJECTIVE: To review and summarize research findings applicable to post-stroke gait quantification and analysis, with a focus on the latest gait analysis system technologies, post-stroke gait data processing and analysis techniques, and their feasibility and potential value in the clinical setting. METHODS: Search terms included “stroke, gait analysis, assessment, lower limb, spatiotemporal, kinematics, kinetics, plantar pressure, electromyography (EMG), machine learning, statistics” in Chinese and English. CNKI and PubMed databases were searched for relevant articles published from January 2000 to December 2021. A few of classical distant documents were also included. The initial screening was performed by reading the titles and abstracts of the articles. Duplicate studies, low-quality journals and irrelevant documents were excluded and 62 articles were finally included for review. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Traditional qualitative gait analysis is primarily based on observational gait and is therefore subjective and largely influenced by the observer’s experience. Quantitative gait analysis, on the other hand, provides measured parameters with good accuracy and repeatability for diagnostic and comparative assessment throughout the rehabilitation process. The rapid development of smart wearable technologies and artificial intelligence is increasingly drawing more attention to gait research. Although their use in clinical settings is not yet well exploited, these tools are expected to change the status quo in stroke gait quantification by providing the means to acquire, store, and analyze multifactorial complex gait data while capturing its nonlinear dynamic variability and providing the valuable benefit of predictive analysis. Gait analysis is often characterized by a number of specific parameters that describe normal or abnormal gait, including temporal, kinematic, kinetic, and electromyographic parameters. Understanding the factors associated with walking function can help clinicians and researchers identify gait-related parameters that should focus on when assessing walking function. As conventional statistical methods are no longer adequate to handle the large data volumes with high heterogeneity and complexity generated by instrumented gait analysis, and gait analysis involves a large number of interdependent parameters that are difficult to interpret due to the large amount of data and their interrelationships. To simplify the evaluation, the application of machine learning to gait analysis is a promising solution. © 2023, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

Though these models are challenging to implement, they serve as essential tools for establishing or characterizing the neurodevelopmental trajectories that lead to increased risk of psychopathology. In this chapter, we will describe methods that can be used to quantify maternal behavior in rats and mice, with particular emphasis on the use of newly developed video recording and machine learning approaches.

A cluster can be defined as a collection of objects which are “homogeneous” between them and are “heterogeneous” to the objects belonging to other clusters. Many areas encounter clustering based applications including the fields of medical, image processing, engineering, economics, social sciences, biology, machine learning and data mining. Clustering goes under unsupervised learning where no labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Even though many classical clustering algorithms can be found, most of such suffer from severe drawbacks such as sensitivity over initial cluster centroids and hence can be easily trapped in local optimum solutions. The other main problem with the data clustering algorithms is that it cannot be standardized. On the other hand, clustering can be considered under optimizations which goes to the category of NP hard optimization making more difficult in solving. Addressing such NP hard problems, meta-heuristics play a remarkable role in optimization. Since its appearance from more than a decade ago, Firefly Algorithm (FA), a stochastic meta- heuristic in nature inspired algorithms has shown significant performance in giving solutions to many optimization problems. Hence FA has been used in research addressing the problem of clustering optimization. This chapter forestalls the ability of firefly algorithm in solving data clustering problem. It presents an introduction to clustering and the performance of FA, briefly reviews and summarizes some of the recent firefly-based algorithms used for data clustering with the emphasis on how FA has been combined/ hybridized with other methods to contribute to the problem of data clustering. Further it discusses on different representations, initializations, and the used cluster validation criteria in FA based clustering methods. The chapter also discusses why FA is to be more useful for clustering over other methods and what features made it more suitable for handling the clustering problem compared with other meta-heuristics. Finally, it focuses on the limitations that have been found in the literature on clustering grounded on FA-based applications and discusses possible avenues in future. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Clustering; Firefly algorithm; Meta-heuristics; Unsupervised,Book Chapter,Scopus

The extensive amount of collected data can be preprocessed, scaled, classified, and finally, used for predicting future events with machine learning (ML) methods. In traditional ML approaches, data is sent to and processed in a central server, which encounters communication overhead, processing delay, privacy leakage, and security issues. To overcome these challenges, each client can be trained locally based on its available data and by learning from the global model. This decentralized learning approach is referred to as federated learning (FL). However, in large-scale networks, there may be clients with varying computational resource capabilities. This may lead to implementation and scalability challenges for FL techniques. In this paper, we first introduce some recently implemented real-life applications of FL underlying the applications that are suitable for FL-based resource-constrained IoT environments. We then emphasize the core challenges of implementing the FL algorithms from the perspective of resource limitations (e.g., memory, bandwidth, and energy budget) of client devices.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been successfully used in developing estimation models for solving and optimization of structural engineering problems. In optimization, swarm intelligence-based algorithms have been generally used to provide machine learning data. In this chapter, a review of ANNs applications in civil engineering is presented. Then, examples of structural optimization that propose an estimation model are presented. The problems include benchmark structural optimization problems, tuned mass dampers, and reinforced concrete retaining walls. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs); Machine learning; Optimization; Structural systems; Swarm-intelligence algorithms,Book Chapter,Scopus

The success of deep learning stems from relaxing the need for the non-trivial task of feature-engineering. However, this remarkable success is conditioned on manually annotating a large amount of data points to generate suitable training datasets to supervise training of these networks. Since manual data annotation is time-consuming and expensive in many applications, learning in data-scarce regimes has been a major recent area of research focus in machine learning (ML) and AI. Transferring and reusing knowledge from a related learning problem is a core strategy for addressing challenges of learning in data-scarce regimens. Transfer learning is not a new field in ML and several great survey exist on this topic [63, 95, 98, 105, 120]. However, these existing survey are meant to be general and extensively survey many works in the area. In this chapter, we survey a very specific subset of works in this area. Our goal is to explore a framework that unifies a broad range of knowledge transfer problems as learning cross-problems relations and similarities using an representation learning. By representation learning, we mean representing the data in the input space in a latent embedding space. The latent embedding space is meant as an intermediate space to explore relationships between several ML problems. We review the recently developed algorithms that use this strategy to address several primary transfer learning settings in five primary area of: (i) online and offline multitask learning, (ii) lifelong learning and continual learning, (iii) low-shot learning, including, few-shot learning and zero-shot learning, (iv) domain adaptation, and (v) collective/distributed learning.

They have demonstrated extraordinary superiority in various real-world applications like computer vision, medical diagnostic systems, agriculture, robotics, and many more. It enables automating the computer-aided system and drastically reducing the human workload where correct prediction with accurate precision is needed. On the other side, as technology advances, a vast amount of data is generated, raising the problem complexity and computational challenges of real-world applications. Furthermore, machine learning, deep learning, and the majority of real-world applications have complex optimization problems within themselves that must be adequately addressed for better and more accurate analysis. Nonetheless, we believe that swarm intelligence-based approaches to deep learning have traditionally been understudied and may ultimately deliver similar advances in AI capabilities - either building on those provided by deep learning or offering whole new ones. Swarm intelligence approaches are frequently employed to solve a wide range of optimization issues. Nowadays, swarm intelligence-based methods are attracting a lot of attention from the research communities of different domains because previous research in complex optimization has shown that behavioral patterns and phenomena observed in nature have the ability to facilitate the foundation for many optimization algorithms and solve problems efficiently. Swarm intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning, on the other hand, each has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Recently, research communities have discovered an interest in integrating these concepts in order to overcome the limitations of each domain and give rise to a new paradigm known as evolutionary machine learning or evolutionary deep learning. In the case of machine learning and deep learning, the “curse of dimensionality,” non-convex optimization, automatic parameter optimization, and optimal architecture are just a few of the issues that can be efficiently addressed with swarm intelligence, whereas in the case of swarm intelligence, slow convergence, local optima stagnation, and extensive computation cost can be addressed with the machine learning and deep learning community. Therefore, a robust and self-efficient model can be developed by integrating these concepts to solve the complex problem associated with real-world applications. This hybrid approach benefits the majority of research domains. Thus, this chapter will primarily present the ideas, challenges, and recent trends of an integrative approach of swarm intelligence with deep learning, which is currently in high demand for addressing industrial problems. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Deep learning; Hyperparameter optimization; Neuroevolution; Swarm intelligence,Book Chapter,Scopus

This paper proposes a contract theory-based FL task training model toward minimizing the incentive budget subject to clients being individually rational and incentive compatible in each FL training round. We design a two-dimensional contract model by formally defining two private types of clients, namely data quality and computation effort. To effectively aggregate the trained models, a contract-based aggregator is proposed. We analyze the feasible and optimal contract solutions for the proposed contract model. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework and contract model can effectively improve the generation accuracy of FL tasks.

However, in most practical scenarios, the two datasets are drawn according to two different distributions, the source distribution and the target distribution. In this context, the use of classical machine learning algorithms often fails as models trained on the source data provide poor performances on the target data. To solve this problem, many transfer learning techniques have been developed following one of the three main strategies: parameter-based transfer, instance-based transfer and feature-based transfer. The choice of the appropriate strategy is mainly determined by the nature of the shift between the source and target distributions. For example, to deal with the problem of sampling bias, when part of the population is over- or under-represented in the training set, instance-based approaches are useful to adequately reweight the source data in the training phase. If the shift is caused by a change in data acquisition, such as sensor drift, feature-based methods help to correct the shift by learning a common feature representation for the source and target data. For a real application, it is really a challenge to choose in advance the best transfer learning strategy and one often needs to evaluate different models in practice. As the different transfer methods were introduced by various contributors, no common framework is today available for a rapid development. To tackle this issue, we propose a Python library for transfer learning: ADAPT (Awesome Domain Adaptation Python Toolbox), which allows practitioners to compare the results of many methods on their particular problem. ADAPT is an open-source library providing the implementation of several transfer learning methods. The library is suited for scikit-learn estimator objects (objects which implement fit and predict methods) and tensorflow models. It allows to evaluate very easily the benefits of transfer learning methods on real data. In this chapter, we propose to illustrate the different features of the ADAPT library on both synthetic and real datasets. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

Classical TL methods typically rely on importance weighting—a predictor is trained based on the training losses weighted according to the importance (i.e., the test-over-training density ratio). However, as real-world machine learning tasks are becoming increasingly complex, high-dimensional, and dynamical, novel approaches are explored to cope with such challenges recently.

This in turn led to huge losses, especially in the financial resources available for the project as well as the time required to complete it. As a result of this, the research community has developed different methods for estimating effort in software projects in the hope of achieving high levels of accuracy and efficiency in the use of available resources. Among those methods that have proven to be accurate in estimating the effort of software projects is the use of machine learning (ML) techniques, especially the case-based reasoning technique (CBR). This technique is based on adapting previously successful solutions for similar software projects. However, the CBR technique suffers from a problem which is its multiple parameters that are difficult to be tuned. This justifies the importance of the adaptation and adjustment process as an essential part of CBR to produce accurate and efficient results with least absolute estimation error. In this paper, one of the most efficient multi-objective evolutionary techniques, the Genetic Algorithm (GA), are used to help find the best set of classical CBR parameters (feature selection, feature weighting, similarity measures, and k number of nearest neighbors) to produce the most accurate effort estimates for software projects. The proposed CBR-GA model showed the effectiveness of using the GA algorithm to search for the best combination of CBR parameters and thus improve its accuracy. This in turn is beneficial for project managers in the early financial planning phase for effort estimation and thus project cost control. To validate the proposed CBR-GA model, we used a set of public benchmark datasets available on PROMISE data repository, in addition we used a set of reliable evaluation metrics. The obtained results are promising in terms of accuracy and significance tests.

A core aspect of GAD is worry, which is associated with negative health outcomes, accentuating a need for simple treatments for worry. The present study leveraged pretreatment individual differences to predict personalized treatment response to a digital intervention. Methods: Linear mixed-effect models were used to model changes in daytime and nighttime worry duration and frequency for 163 participants who completed a six-day worry postponement intervention. Ensemble-based machine learning regression and classification models were implemented to predict changes in worry across the intervention. Model feature importance was derived using SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP). Results: Moderate predictive performance was obtained for predicting changes in daytime worry duration (test r2 = 0.221, AUC = 0.77) and nighttime worry frequency (test r2 = 0.164, AUC = 0.72), while poor predictive performance was obtained for nighttime worry duration and daytime worry frequency. Baseline levels of worry and subjective health complaints were most important in driving model predictions. Limitations: A complete-case analysis was leveraged to analyze the present data, which was collected from participants that were Dutch and majority female. Conclusions: This study suggests that treatment response to a digital intervention for GAD can be accurately predicted using baseline characteristics. Particularly, this worry postponement intervention may be most beneficial for individuals with high baseline worry but fewer subjective health complaints. The present findings highlight the complexities of and need for further research into daily worry dynamics and the personalizable utility of digital interventions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Digital intervention; Generalized anxiety disorder; Machine learning; Personalized mental health care; Worry dynamics,Article,Scopus

In this paper, we classified and regressed defects with different depths. A transient thermal grating (TTG) method induced by a pulsed laser is used to characterize the properties of surface defects. Based on thermo-elasticity theory, a theoretical model with different types of surface defects is established with the finite element method (FEM). Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) excited by the TTG method propagate at the surface of a sample with defects at different penetration depths and are measured by a vibrometer. By combining the simulation and experimental results, the time–frequency scalograms of 8200 images were obtained by wavelet transform analysis. 70 % of the images are randomly selected to train the residual network (Resnet) model, and the remaining data (2460 images), as well as 10 scalograms in an independent experiment, are used as previously unknown experimental signals to test the robustness of the Resnet model. The results indicate that the Resnet with scalograms via wavelet transform achieves a 96.21 % classification accuracy on the validation set, with a prediction accuracy of 90.00 % for the 10 scalograms. Moreover, compared with three widely used machine learning algorithms, VGG16, back propagation (BP), and support vector machine (SVM), this method achieves the highest classification accuracy. Finally, 500 data selected randomly from the previously trained experimental database and 10 data in an independent experiment are used for regression prediction. The result shows that the data are well located along or close to a straight line with a slope of 1. The statistical results suggest that 80.6 % (66.0 %) of the residuals of the experimental data fell within the size range ±10 ?m (±5 ?m).

According to the literature, there are two main strategies to migrate a legacy system: (a) to replace the legacy system by a new one, (b) to incrementally migrate parts from the legacy system to the new one. Incremental migration allows developers to better control the risks that may occur during the migration process. However, this strategy is more complex because it requires decomposition of the legacy system into different parts, e.g. a set of files, and to define the order of migration of them along the migration process. To our knowledge, there is no approach to support developers on those activities. Objective: This paper presents an approach, named MigrationExp, to support incremental language migrations of applications from one source language to another target language. MigrationExp recommends the files that should be migrated first in a particular migration iteration. As a novelty, our approach relies on a ranking model learned, using a learning-to-rank algorithm, from migrations made by developers. Method: We validate our approach in the context of the migrations of Android apps, from Java to Kotlin, a new official language for Android. We train our model using migrations of Java code to Kotlin written by developers on open-source applications. Results: The results show that, on the task of proposing files to migrate, our approach outperforms a previous migration strategy proposed by Google, in terms of its ability to accurately predict empirically observed migration orders. Conclusion: Since most Android applications are written in Java, we conclude that approaches to support developers such as MigrationExp may significantly impact the development of Android applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Android; Java; Kotlin; Learn-to-rank; Machine learning; Ranking model; Software evolution and maintenance; Software migration; Software modernization; Supervised learning,Article,Scopus

Helix 12 ((H)12) is one of the important helices at VDR ligand binding and its conformational changes are controlled by the binding of agonists and antagonists molecules. Various molecular modeling studies are available to explain the agonistic and antagonistic activity of vitamin D analogs. In this work, for the first time, we attempted to generate a machine learning model with fingerprints, 2D, 3D and MD descriptors that are specific to Vitamin D analogs and VDR. Initially, 2D and 3D descriptors and fingerprints of 1003 vitamin D analogs were calculated using CDK and RDKit. The machine learning model was generated using descriptors and fingerprints. Further, 80 Vitamin D analogs (40 VDR agonists + 40 VDR antagonists) were docked in the VDR active site. 50ns MD simulation was performed for each protein-ligand complex. Different MD descriptors such as Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA), radius of gyration, PC1 and PC2 were calculated and considered along with CDK and RDKit descriptors as features for machine learning calculations. A few other descriptors that are related to VDR conformational changes such as conformation of the (H)12, the angle at kink were considered for machine learning model generation. It was observed that the descriptors calculated from VDR conformational changes i) were able to distinguish between agonists and antagonists ii) provide key and comprehensive information about the unique binding characteristics of agonists and antagonists iii) provide a strong basis for the machine learning model generation. Overall, this study attempts the utilization of descriptors that are specific to a protein conformation will be helpful for the generation of an efficient machine learning model. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Helix12; Machine learning model generation; MD descriptors; Vitamin D receptor,Article,Scopus

The proposed framework follows a two-step procedure. In the first step, we recast the reliability assessment of MSS as a machine learning problem using the framework of PINN. A feedforward neural network with two individual loss groups is constructed to encode the initial condition and the state transitions governed by ordinary differential equations in MSS, respectively. Next, we tackle the problem of high imbalance in the magnitudes of back-propagated gradients from a multi-task learning perspective and establish a continuous latent function for system reliability assessment. Particularly, we regard each element of the loss function as an individual learning task and project a task's gradient onto the norm plane of any other task with a conflicting gradient by taking the projecting conflicting gradients (PCGrad) method. We demonstrate the applications of the proposed framework for MSS reliability assessment in a variety of scenarios, including time-independent or dependent state transitions, where system scales increase from small to medium.

Twenty-two specimens with various subsurface defect dimensions are designed and fabricated for laser ultrasonic experiments, and a total of 220 labeled laser ultrasonic signals are obtained for training and verifying ML models. Twelve features, including four time-domain features (maximum, minimum, peak-to-peak, and |Neg|/Pos value of the laser generated Rayleigh ultrasonic waves) and eight wavelet energy features, are identified and extracted as sensitive feature vectors for establishing the dataset. The principal component analysis (PCA) is implemented as dimensionality reduction method of feature vectors to optimize the recognition algorithm and improve the detection accuracy. Three widely used ML models in NDE, adaptive boosting (Adaboost), extreme gradient boosting (XGBboost), and support vector machine (SVM), combined with the PCA are proposed and compared for detecting both the width and depth of subsurface defects. The PCA-XGBoost achieves the highest recognition rate of 98.48%, and is therefore identified as the most effective approach for analyzing laser-ultrasonic signals. Unlike published reports, the proposed model is trained and evaluated with experimental data covered various classification labels, which is more adaptive and reliable in practical application than the models established using simulated data or limited experimental data. In other applications, as long as sufficient laser ultrasonic data with regards to various defect properties (dimensions, orientations, locations, shapes, etc.) can be acquired, the developed approach can realize accurate detection of corresponding defects. © 2022",Laser ultrasonics; Machine learning; Nondestructive evaluation; Principal component analysis; Subsurface defects; Wavelet package transform,Article,Scopus

The nodes which are participating in IOT network are basically attracted by the cyber-attack targets. Attack and identification of anomalies in IoT infrastructure is a growing problem in the IoT domain. Machine Learning Based Ensemble Intrusion Detection (MLEID) method is applied in order to resolve the drawback by minimizing malicious actions in related botnet attacks on Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) and Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) protocols. The proposed work has two significant contributions which are a selection of features and detection of attacks. New features are chosen from Improved Ant Colony Optimization (IACO) in the feature selection, and then the detection of attacks is carried out based on a combination of their possible properties. The IACO approach is focused on defining the attacker’s important features against HTTP and MQTT. In the IACO algorithm, the constant factor is calculated against HTTP and MQTT based on the mean function for each element. Attack detection, the performance of several machine learning models are Distance Decision Tree (DDT), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Mahalanobis Distance Support Vector Machine (MDSVM) were compared with predicting accurate attacks on the IoT network. The outcomes of these classifiers are combined into the ensemble model. The proposed MLEID strategy has effectively established malicious incidents. The UNSW-NB15 dataset is used to test the MLEID technique using data from simulated IoT sensors. Besides, the proposed MLEID technique has a greater detection rate and an inferior rate of false-positive compared to other conventional techniques. © 2023, Tech Science Press.

If an EMG signal contaminated by high-level noise is recorded, then it will be useless and can’t be used for any healthcare application. In this research work, a new machine learning-based paradigm is proposed to automate the detection of low-level and high-level noises occurring in different channels of high density and multi-channel sEMG signals. A modified version of mel fre-quency cepstral coefficients (mMFCC) is proposed for the extraction of features from sEMG channels along with other statistical parameters i-e complexity coef-ficient, hurst exponent, and root mean square. Several state-of-the-art classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Ensemble Bagged Trees, Ensemble Sub-space Discriminant, and Logistic Regression are used to automatically identify an EMG channel either bad or good based on these extracted features. Comparison-based analyses of these classifiers have also been considered based on total classification accuracy, prediction speed (observations/sec), and processing time. The proposed method is tested on 320 simulated EMG channels as well as 640 experimental EMG channels.

We introduce the sparse random feature expansion to obtain parsimonious random feature models. We leverage ideas from compressive sensing to generate random feature expansions with theoretical guarantees even in the data-scarce setting.

However, the Current Transformer (CT) in the differential protection system mal-operates during inrush currents. CT saturates due to magnetizing inrush currents and causes false tripping of the differential relays. Moreover, identification of tripping in protection relay either due to inrush current or internal faults needs to be diagnosed. For the above problem, continuous monitoring of transformer breather and CT terminals with thermal camera helps detect the tripping in relay due to inrush or internal fault. The transformer’s internal fault leads to high breathing process in the transformer breather, never for inrush currents. During inrush currents, CT temperature is increased. Continuous monitoring of breather and CT of the transformer through thermal imaging and radiometric pixels detect the causes of CT saturation and differentiates maloperation.

Crop recommendation for a specific region is a tedious process as it can be affected by various variables such as soil type and climatic parameters. At the same time, crop yield prediction was based on several features like area, irrigation type, temperature, etc. The recent advancements of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models pave the way to design effective crop recommendation and crop prediction models. In this view, this paper presents a novel Multimodal Machine Learning Based Crop Recommendation and Yield Prediction (MMML-CRYP) technique.

At the initial stage, equilibrium optimizer (EO) with kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) technique is employed for effectual recommendation of crops. Next, random forest (RF) technique was executed for predicting the crop yield accurately. For reporting the improved performance of the MMML-CRYP system, a wide range of simulations were carried out and the results are investigated using benchmark dataset.

The consistency of those photos is impacted by night-video systems because the contrast between high-profile items and different atmospheric conditions, such as mist, fog, dust etc. The pictures then shift in intensity, colour, polarity and consistency. A general challenge for computer vision analyses lies in the horrid appearance of night images in arbitrary illumination and ambient environments. In recent years, target recognition techniques focused on deep learning and machine learning have become standard algorithms for object detection with the exponential growth of computer performance capabilities. However, the identification of objects in the night world also poses further problems because of the distorted backdrop and dim light. The Correlation aware LSTM based YOLO (You Look Only Once) classifier method for exact object recognition and determining its properties under night vision was a major inspiration for this work. In order to create virtual target sets similar to daily environments, we employ night images as inputs; and to obtain high enhanced image using histogram based enhancement and iterative wiener filter for removing the noise in the image. The process of the feature extraction and feature selection was done for electing the potential features using the Adaptive internal linear embedding (AILE) and uplift linear discriminant analysis (ULDA). The region of interest mask can be segmented using the Recurrent-Phase Level set Segmentation. Finally, we use deep convolution feature fusion and region of interest pooling to integrate the presently extremely sophisticated quicker Long short term memory based (LSTM) with YOLO method for object tracking system. A range of experimental findings demonstrate that our technique achieves high average accuracy with a precision of 99.7% for object detection of SSAN datasets that is considerably more than that of the other standard object detection mechanism. Our approach may therefore satisfy the true demands of night scene target detection applications. We very much believe that our method will help future research. © 2023, Tech Science Press.

The purpose of this paper is to combine these promising technologies to maintain the privacy of patient data during the disease prediction process.

Here, we show that multiple supervised learning algorithms deployed on a large database of morphological reconstructions can systematically classify neuronal and glial arbors with nearly perfect accuracy and precision. Moreover, we report multiple morphometric properties, both size related and size independent, that differ substantially between these cell types.

Many countries have acquired and adopted surveillance systems using high-definition CCTV cameras to secure their environment. Thus, automated CCTV surveillance systems can serve as security providers for identifying the behaviour of suspicion humans or intruders based on their actions from previous stages through the CCTV footages is a challenging task. This can be achieved using suspicious behaviour models that use machine learning approaches to a limited extent. It has been found that many of earlier approaches have made use of deep learning, machine learning, IoT and fuzzy logic techniques. The proposed suspicious behaviour detection model (SHBDM) effectively uses CNN model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, known as Inception V3 (VGG-16), for image feature extraction. This system was implemented in Python on an open-source platform. The use of Inception V3 + LSTM resulted in an improved precision accuracy of 88.8% when compared with VGG-16 + LSTM and simple CNN model. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",CCTV surveillance systems; CNN model; Inception V3; Security; Suspicious behaviour detection models (SHBDM),Book Chapter,Scopus

From day to day, new cases are still discovered. To help governments and health policymakers make appropriate decisions and impose restrictions to reduce the prevalence of tuberculosis, efficient forecasting methods are required to be applied. Machine learning and deep learning techniques are commonly used due to their abilities in producing accurate results. In this paper, seven different models are applied to accomplish this objective, including SARIMAX, LSTM, CNN-LSTM Hybrid, MLP network, SVR, XGboost, and RF Regression models. These models are applied to forecast pulmonary positive, negative, and TB incidence cases. The models with the lowest errors are then chosen and used to forecast the number of pulmonary positive, negative, and TB incidence cases. The results of the experiments showed that the CNN-LSTM Hybrid and MLP networks achieved the lowest forecasting errors compared to the other models and were chosen for forecasting pulmonary negative, positive, and TB incidence cases from 2020 to 2029. The forecasting results revealed that there would be 117.861557 new pulmonary negative incidences, 153.029385 new pulmonary positive incidences, and 414.4704 new tuberculosis incidence cases. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",CNN-STLM hybrid; Deep learning; Forecasting; Machine learning; MLP; SVR; Tuberculosis; XGboost,Book Chapter,Scopus

This urges the need for a context-aware, automatic classification of text documents into standard scientific categories. Document classification is a significant application of supervised learning which requires a labeled dataset for training the classifier. However, research publication records available on Google Scholar and dblp services are not labeled. First, manual annotation of a large body of scientific research work based on standard scientific terminology requires domain expertise and is extremely time-consuming. Second, hierarchical labeling of records facilitates a more effective and context-aware retrieval of documents. In this paper, we propose an ontology-driven classification technique based on zero-shot learning in conjunction with agglomerative clustering to automatically label a scientific literature dataset related to CE and CS.

Two parallel neural networks are designed to take one input each- one being the detected face and the other being an embedding from the dataset. The outputs of the two networks are compared to predict whether the detected face is the same as the input face or not.

A novel method for assessing a user’s life quality score is presented, which employs a deep learning architecture. A convolutional neural network and a support vector machine (SVM) were coupled to develop this solution for multimodal data. Three tests were conducted to determine the accuracy of the estimation method. In the research on living standard estimation, eight life factors were chosen to make up life quality. Next, the regression of life quality score experiment gives scores of each parameter where the distribution of the difference between the actual and predicted outcomes is known as error of neural network. Except for the mental health category, these findings suggest that the attributes required for life quality assessment may be retrieved from data. One of the reasons why estimating the mental health scale was challenging might be because the learning framework was unable to extract an adequate feature for estimation. As a result, we used eye movement to determine mental health. It was shown that estimate is achievable, and the suggested approach employing different modes of activity data proved efficacy for estimating makeup life quality, as well as for extracting high-dimensional information about a human’s life quality, such as their pleasure level toward social activities.

The posts or comments collected from the social networking sites are needed to be analysed for identifying the positive or negative public sentiments regarding the products or services of any organization in order to improve their services. Over the last few years, research on sentiment analysis using Machine Learning (ML) tools is very popular. However, the sentiment analysis of Bengali data corpus using a Machine Learning tool is limited. It has been observed that the ML models for sentiment analysis are suffering from misclassification and researchers are still trying to come up with better solutions. In this paper, a Machine Learning approach is proposed for sentiment analysis of the Bengali data set collected from Facebook. Since the posts or comments that exhibit negative polarity are more actionable than the positive ones, the prime aim of this paper is to identify the negative sentiments without being misclassified and introduces a new technique to achieve almost 100% specificity by tuning the class weight of the ML classification model. We have also tried to improve the accuracy of ML classifiers during the sentiment analysis by combining the Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging with Term Frequency—Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization.

This has created an opportunity to study social network for understanding the mental state of the users. Studies show that depression generally has an impact on the writing style and corresponding language use. In addition, user persona on social media can also provide us a lot of information about the mental state of the user. The primary aim of our research is to study user’s persona and posts on Twitter and identify the attributes that may indicate depressive symptoms of online users. We used machine learning approaches and natural language processing techniques for training our data and evaluating the efficiency of our proposed method. We proposed a two-level depression detection in which the social media features, personality trait and sentiment analysis of user’ biography provide us an opportunity to identify suspected depressed users.

In recent years, breast cancer survival rates have increased significantly, due to factors such as earlier detection. Treatment for breast cancer largely depends on identifying the type of mass of tissue formed, which is known as a tumor. If normal cells grow in an uncontrollable manner the tumor is called benign (non-cancerous). But, if the cells’ growth is out of control and their behavior is abnormal, then the tumor is called malignant (cancerous). During the invasive, (i.e. curable) stage of cancer, only 10–15% part of the breast contains cancerous cells. Therefore, it is difficult to diagnose it using mammography. However, the development of machine learning techniques has allowed early detection of breast cancer in clinical trials. This paper presents a comparative study of different machine learning techniques for detecting breast cancer. It also presents an auto-encoder model that performs breast cancer detection in an unsupervised manner. It attempts to identify a compact representation of features that are strongly related to breast cancer. The techniques are tested on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle.

However, it is difficult to identify which sources are reliable and which are disseminating false information. So far, many models have been derived to detect fake news or misinformation from social media news using machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) techniques. This chapter aims to enhance the detection accuracy by representing the text of social media news in a hybrid format using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. We model the input data of news text in a hybrid representation using TF-IDF with N-grams model combined with Latent Semantic Indexing. The main objective of the hybrid text representation is to represent news text by considering the three important factors of text, viz. the important words in the text, their sequence of occurrence, and their semantic meaning. We applied different ML and DL techniques for news classification and compared the performance of fake news detection models with and without hybrid text representation. The obtained results evidence that there is a significant improvement in detection accuracies when the news text is represented in a hybrid format as proposed in our approach. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Fake news detection; Latent Semantic Indexing; Text representation; Vectorization,Book Chapter,Scopus

In addition, EMS is improved by combining the actor-network of TD3 with Gumbel-Softmax to realize mode selection and torque distribution simultaneously, which is a discrete (mode)-continuous (engine speed) hybrid action space and not applicable in original TD3. To reduce the unreasonable exploration of agents in discrete action, a rule-based mode control mechanism (RBMCM) is designed and involved in EMS.

Simulation results show that the gap between the proposed strategy and the benchmark dynamic programming (DP) is reduced to 2.55% in the selected training cycle. Regarding the unknown testing cycles, the fuel economy of agents trained by the improved method overperforms traditional DRL-based EMS when it reaches more than 90% of the DP-based benchmarking.

Combining the readings of serial numbers and energy meter units, an automatic billing system using the Internet of Things and a graphical user interface is deployable in a real-time setup. However, such region extraction and character recognition become challenging due to image variations caused by several factors such as partial occlusion due to dust on the meter display, orientation and scale variations caused by camera positioning, and non-uniform illumination caused by shades. To this end, our work evaluates and compares the state-of-the art deep learning algorithm You Only Look Once (YOLO) along with traditional handcrafted features for text extraction and recognition. Our image dataset contains 10,000 images of electrical energy meters and is further expanded by data augmentation such as in-plane rotation and scaling to make the deep learning algorithms robust to these image variations. For training and evaluation, the image dataset is annotated to produce the ground truth of all the images. Consequently, YOLO achieves superior performance over the traditional handcrafted features with an average recognition rate of 98% for all the digits. It proves to be robust against the mentioned image variations compared with the traditional handcrafted features.

Cloud computing has traditionally played an important role in establishing IoT. However, fog computing has recently emerged as a new field complementing cloud computing due to its enhanced mobility, location awareness, heterogeneity, scalability, low latency, and geographic distribution. However, IoT networks are vulnerable to unwanted assaults because of their open and shared nature. As a result, various fog computing-based security models that protect IoT networks have been developed. A distributed architecture based on an intrusion detection system (IDS) ensures that a dynamic, scalable IoT environment with the ability to disperse centralized tasks to local fog nodes and which successfully detects advanced malicious threats is available. In this study, we examined the time-related aspects of network traffic data. We presented an intrusion detection model based on a two-layered bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) with an attention mechanism for traffic data classification verified on the UNSW-NB15 benchmark dataset. We showed that the suggested model outperformed numerous leading-edge Network IDS that used machine learning models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

However, the established biomarkers have variable shapes and sizes, and pixel-level medical imaged labels are hard to obtain in practice, both making challenges to the localization and classification of them. Therefore, it is essential to locate and classify retinal biomarkers simultaneously under weak supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel method for weakly supervised localization and classification of biomarkers in OCT images, named LCG-Net, based on generative adversarial network (GAN) and attention, using image-level labels for training. The structure-texture information is used to improve the quality of the reconstructed healthy-alike image. And erasure strategy is introduced to ensure the attention maps cover biomarker regions wholly and obtain the biomarker class information. Besides, we fused residual mask in reconstruction and attention mask to locate biomarkers. Our results demonstrate that the proposed LCG-Net achieved higher DSC, Recall and IoU than other comparison methods on the local AB dataset and the public Cell dataset. The proposed method achieved averaged Dice 0.504 for seven disease-related biomarkers, and the Dice for healthy images is 0.922.

From a couple of years, advancements in the domain of machine learning, such as deep learning, have shown substantial success.

In this article, we proposed a new deep learning architecture with optimization algorithm for cucumber and potato leaf diseases recognition. The proposed architecture consists of five steps. In the first step, data augmentation is performed to increase the numbers of training samples. In the second step, pre-trained DarkNet19 deep model is opted and fine-tuned that later utilized for the training of fine-tuned model through transfer learning. Deep features are extracted from the global pooling layer in the next step that is refined using Improved Cuckoo search algorithm. The best selected features are finally classified using machine learning classifiers such as SVM, and named a few more for final classification results. The proposed architecture is tested using publicly available datasets–Cucumber National Dataset and Plant Village.

In this work, we have presented several viewpoints where resource efficiency in manufacturing-based industries of comparable or disparate nature can interact in more than one way. This is to accomplish an interaction among industries particularly placed in the industrial zones, where waste material exchange can serve as a potential feedstock and energy sources can be integrated for a mutual benefit between participating firms.

The knowledge presented in the literature needs to be systematized in such a way that claims and hypotheses can be easily found, accessed, and validated. Knowledge graphs can provide such a framework for semantic knowledge representation from literature. However, in order to build a knowledge graph, it is necessary to extract knowledge as relationships between biomedical entities and normalize both entities and relationship types. In this paper, we present and compare a few rule-based and machine learning-based (Naive Bayes, Random Forests as examples of traditional machine learning methods and DistilBERT, PubMedBERT, T5, and SciFive-based models as examples of modern deep learning transformers) methods for scalable relationship extraction from biomedical literature, and for the integration into the knowledge graphs. We examine how resilient are these various methods to unbalanced and fairly small datasets. Our experiments show that transformer-based models handle well both small (due to pre-training on a large dataset) and unbalanced datasets. The best performing model was the PubMedBERT-based model fine-tuned on balanced data, with a reported F1-score of 0.92. The distilBERT-based model followed with an F1-score of 0.89, performing faster and with lower resource requirements.

Two meta models which cover for the process-based model were firstly developed—meta forest growth and meta forest biomass and dead organic matter carbon (FBDC) by adopting a multi-layer feedforward neural network (ML-FFNN) with a scaled conjugated gradient for training. Due to dependence of the forest carbon stocks on growth and climate variability, it was possible to interrelate the two meta models, and define a single integrated meta model. For the meta forest growth model, scientific uncertainties surrounding the driving mechanisms of tree growth in the process-based model increased model complexity, resulting in a relatively fair model performance (R2 = 0.776), compared to a near-perfect meta FBDC model performance (R2 = 0.997). The integrated meta model maintained an intermediate performance (R2 = 0.822). The integrated meta model did well to capture the spatial patterning of carbon stocks when compared to those of previous process-based models, although the former had a limited capacity to capture extreme highs associated with Quercus acutissima Carruth.

In this context, a hybrid approach using knowledge- and physics-based methods was proposed to characterize potential inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Initially, supervised machine learning (ML) models were trained to predict a ligand-binding affinity of ca. 2 million compounds with the correlation on a test set of R=0.748±0.044. Atomistic simulations were then used to refine the outcome of the ML model. Using LIE/FEP calculations, nine compounds from the top 100 ML inhibitors were suggested to bind well to the protease with the domination of van der Waals interactions. Furthermore, the binding affinity of these compounds is also higher than that of nirmatrelvir, which was recently approved by the US FDA to treat COVID-19. In addition, the ligands altered the catalytic triad Cys145 - His41 - Asp187, possibly disturbing the biological activity of SARS-CoV-2. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",FEP; LIE; Machine learning; SARS-CoV-2 Mpro; Supervised learning,Article,Scopus

In recent years, some countries have set renewables to meet future energy needs, with the primary goal of reducing emissions and promoting sustainable growth, primarily the use of wind and solar power. To achieve the prediction of wind power generation, several deep and machine learning models are constructed in this article as base models. These regression models are Deep neural network (DNN), k-nearest neighbor (KNN) regressor, long short-term memory (LSTM), averaging model, random forest (RF) regressor, bagging regressor, and gradient boosting (GB) regressor. In addition, data cleaning and data preprocessing were performed to the data. The dataset used in this study includes 4 features and 50530 instances. To accurately predict the wind power values, we propose in this paper a new optimization technique based on stochastic fractal search and particle swarm optimization (SFS-PSO) to optimize the parameters of LSTM network. Five evaluation criteria were utilized to estimate the efficiency of the regression models, namely, mean absolute error (MAE), Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), mean square error (MSE), coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE). The experimental results illustrated that the proposed optimization of LSTM using SFS-PSO model achieved the best results with R2 equals 99.99% in predicting the wind power values. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

Most SOH estimation methods based on the machine learning assume that the training and testing data follow the uniform distribution. However, the distribution of the datasets obtained at the different working conditions has discrepancy, which also increases its inherently large computational burden. Therefore, a novel SOH estimation method based on multiple health indicators (HIs) fusion using transfer learning and deep belief network (DBN)-long short-term memory (LSTM) hybrid network is proposed. Transfer learning is used to learn the shared features in the source domain and the target domain. Then, aiming at the insufficiency of shallow network in mining data features, DBN is utilized for SOH estimation. And considering the influence of historical information on future prediction, LSTM cell is used to replace the traditional BP neural network structure. Comparative study is conducted by applying deep and shallow network on the measured data for monitoring SOH of the battery in applications.

There is an increasing need to detect similar codes for hunting vulnerability with the increase of critical security issues in smart contracts. Binary similarity detection that quantitatively measures the given code diffing has been widely adopted to facilitate critical security analysis. However, due to the difference between common programs and smart contract, such as diversity of bytecode generation and highly code homogeneity, directly adopting existing graph matching and machine learning based techniques to smart contracts suffers from low accuracy, poor scalability and the limitation of binary similarity on function level. Therefore, this paper investigates graph neural network to detect smart contract binary code similarity at the program level, where we conduct instruction-level normalization to reduce the noise code for smart contract pre-processing and construct contract control flow graphs to represent smart contracts. In particular, two improved Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) models are explored to encode the contract graphs into quantitatively vectors, which can capture the semantic information and the program-wide control flow information with temporal orders. Then we can efficiently accomplish the similarity detection by measuring the distance between two targeted contract embeddings. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficient of our proposed method, extensive experiments are performed on two real-world datasets, i.e., smart contracts from Ethereum and Enterprise Operation System (EOS) blockchain-based platforms. The results show that our proposed approach outperforms three state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, achieving a great improvement up to 6.1% and 17.06% in accuracy. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

At the same time, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models paved the way for designing models that can detect malicious URLs accurately and classify them. With this motivation, the current article develops an Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA) with Deep Learning Enabled Malicious URL Detection and Classification (AFSADL-MURLC) model. The presented AFSADL-MURLC model intends to differentiate the malicious URLs from genuine URLs. To attain this, AFSADL-MURLC model initially carries out data preprocessing and makes use of glove-based word embedding technique. In addition, the created vector model is then passed onto Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) classification to recognize the malicious URLs. Finally, AFSA is applied to the proposed model to enhance the efficiency of GRU model.

It is observed that the atrial arrhythmias and congestive heart failure are closely related, wherein, one promotes the other and their co-existence can increase the mortality rate. Timely diagnosis of these diseases is essential to prevent sudden cardiac failure. In this work, we employ a two-fold approach to classify arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, and normal sinus rhythm using ECG fragments. First, we use a traditional hand-crafted feature based model which involves extraction of a number of linear and non-linear features from the ECG fragments. The linear features capture the time-varying and scale of variability information, whereas the non-linear features help to extract the hidden complexity and quantify the uncertainty of the non-stationary signal. Second, an automatic feature learning based approach is employed which uses a pre-trained deep learning network to automatically extract the relevant detailed information from the ECG time–frequency representations. Finally, we explored the combined effect of the two approaches to diagnose the arrhythmias and congestive heart failure patterns. Additionally, this study makes novel use of the subject-level ECG classification. This work on Physionet database shows that the proposed combined system gives an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision of 99.06%, 99.14%, 99.68%, and 99.32%, respectively, which are better than the state-of-the-art systems.

This is import for the targeted therapy, which is expected to be more effective and less harmful to normal cells than traditional chemotherapy. Meanwhile, due to the rapid development in medical imaging and machine learning technology, we are able to extract more and more “unseen” disease characteristics from medical images. Radiomics, a method that extracts a large number of features from medical images, has been established for a variety of purposes such as a prediction of risks for a particular disease, classification of lesions, a prediction of outcome of patients, etc. Genetic tests can provide prognostic information in breast cancer for both diagnosis and treatment planning. In this study, we developed a radiogenomics method to discover imaging biomarkers on breast MRI for prediction of genetic test results for breast cancer by means of our original sequential forward floating selection (SFFS) coupled with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier that maximizes the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC). Our proposed method aimed at predicting the results of the 95-gene classifier (95-GC) and immune-related 23-gene signature (IRSN-23), which consists of a feature extraction from a tumor region, discovery of biomarkers based on our SFFS feature selection method, and an SVM classifier operated on the discovered imaging biomarkers. Our database contained 118 dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) breast MRI studies from 118 patients. We extracted 318 morphological and texture features from each segmented tumor region on DCE MRI in three phases (i.e., pre-contrast, early phase, and delayed phase).

Identifying suicide risks online via artificial technological advances may help predict suicide. Methods: We built a classifier that detects open messages containing suicidal ideation or behavior-related words in social media via text mining methods and developed the Monitoring-Tracking-Rescuing model, which links data monitoring and tracking to high-risk suicide rescues. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as Long Short-Term Memory and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers were applied to online posts of common social media sites in Taiwan. This model uses a two-step high-risk identification procedure: an automatic prediction process using NLP to classify suicide-risk levels, followed by professional validation by a senior psychiatrist and a nursing faculty specialized in suicidology. Results: From a dataset containing 404 high-risk and 2226 no- or low-risk articles, the sensitivity and specificity of our model reached 80 %. Limitations: The model is limited to data platforms that can be “crawled” and excludes suicide-risk content from graphics, video and audio files. Additionally, machine learning does not provide the best recognition rate from complex online messages. Keywords for high-risk suicide in long articles are difficult to interpret using this model. Finally, the model lacks keywords for suicide-protective factors.

However, EEG signals are unstable and nonlinear and fatigue detection based on one-dimensional features may provide insufficient information, resulting in low recognition efficiency. To resolve these challenges, this paper proposes an EEG-based multi-dimensional feature selection and fusion method to recognise mental fatigue in drivers. First, the EEG signals were decomposed into ?, ? and ? bands, and then the corresponding time domain, frequency domain and nonlinear features were generated respectively. Furthermore, a three-layer feature-selection method based on Logistic Regression, one-way Analysis of Variance and Recursive Feature Elimination (logistic-ARFE) was proposed to solve the feature redundancy. Logistic-ARFE is designed to automatically select the optimal subset of mental fatigue features. Principal component analysis was used to fuse the optimal feature subset from different dimensions to obtain the fusion feature at a cumulative contribution ratio of 90%, which was used as the final feature to express the recognition accuracy of eight conventional machine learning models. A publicly available EEG dataset for driver fatigue was used to validate the proposed method. The final results show that six of the eight models achieve high recognition accuracy, which indicates that the Logistic-ARFE feature selection algorithm has applicability widely.

Pandemic loneliness were more prevalent in female (OR = 1.53, 99 % CI: 1.26–1.85), those who were younger (OR's range 1.42–3.00), women without college degree (OR = 1.44, 99 % CI: 1.01–2.04), those living alone (OR = 1.56, 99 % CI: 1.09–2.23), immigrant men (OR = 1.79, 99 % CI: 1.23–2.60), those with small network (OR's range: 1.73–3.26), those who were absent from work due to COVID-19 related reasons (OR = 2.11, 99 % CI: 1.04–4.28), past-month binge drinkers (OR's range: 1.39–1.70) and cannabis user (OR = 1.47, 99 % CI: 1.12–1.93). The CART algorithm identifies that immigrants who experienced pandemic-triggered job insecurity were the most-at-risk group of severely loneliness. Pandemic loneliness was positively associated with formal help-seeking from mental health professionals (OR = 1.71, 99 % CI: 1.21–2.41), informal help-seeking from social circle (OR = 1.51, 99 % CI: 1.17–1.95), and unmet mental health needs (OR = 1.78, 99 % CI: 1.29–2.49). Limitations: Cross-sectional data prohibits causal inferences. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic converges with loneliness epidemic in Canada. Prevention and intervention programs should target upstream social determinants of mental health, especially the intersection of migration status and COVID-19-related job precarity, to eliminate loneliness during the pandemic. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",COVID-19; Loneliness; Machine learning; Psychiatric epidemiology; Social isolation,Article,Scopus

The variational inputs of systematic properties are treated within the 3D dynamic geometric-elastoplastic analyses. To circumvent numerical challenges in solving the coupled nonlinear problems, a freshly developed dynamic virtual modelling (DVM) technique is employed to determine the inherent relationship between the variational input data and the nonlinear structural response by using a new clustering based extended support vector regression (C-XSVR) algorithm with a novel T-spline polynomial kernel function. The virtual modelling models can be constructed at each time step within the Newmark's time integration procedure, which then can be used to predict deflection, force, and stress of the concerned structure at different periods. The DVM is capable of visibly forecasting potential large deformation nonlinear behaviours in an efficient manner, based on the explicit relationship functions. To demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed framework, nonlinear behaviours of two practical applications under future forecasted working conditions are predicted and validated in the numerical investigations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Dynamic analysis; Geometric nonlinearity; Machine learning; Material nonlinearity; Uncertainty quantification; Virtual modelling,Article,Scopus

Bot detection using machine learning (ML) with flow-based features has been extensively studied in the literature. Existing flow-based detection methods involve significant computational overhead that does not completely capture network communication patterns that might reveal other features of malicious hosts. Recently, Graph-Based Bot Detection methods using ML have gained attention to overcome these limitations, as graphs provide a real representation of network communications. The purpose of this study is to build a botnet malware detection system utilizing centrality measures for graph-based botnet detection and ML. We propose BotSward, a graph-based bot detection system that is based on ML. We apply the efficient centrality measures, which are Closeness Centrality (CC), Degree Centrality (CC), and PageRank (PR), and compare them with others used in the state-of-the-art. The efficiency of the proposed method is verified on the available Czech Technical University 13 dataset (CTU-13). The CTU-13 dataset contains 13 real botnet traffic scenarios that are connected to a command-and-control (C&C) channel and that cause malicious actions such as phishing, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, spam attacks, etc. BotSward is robust to zero-day attacks, suitable for large-scale datasets, and is intended to produce better accuracy than state-of-the-art techniques. The proposed BotSward solution achieved 99% accuracy in botnet attack detection with a false positive rate as low as 0.0001%. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

Accordingly, four machine learning algorithms, including support vector regression (SVR), extra trees (ExTree), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and decision tree regression (DTR), were used as the base models for the purposes of combination and PPV initial prediction. The bagging regressor (BA) was then applied to combine these base models with the efforts of variance reduction, overfitting elimination, and generating more robust predictive models, abbreviated as BA-ExTree, BA-KNN, BA-SVR, and BA-DTR. It is emphasized that the ExTree model has not been considered for predicting blast-induced ground vibration before, and the bagging of ExTree is an innovation aiming to improve the accuracy of the inherently ExTree model, as well. In addition, two empirical models (i.e., USBM and Ambraseys) were also treated and compared with the bagging models to gain a comprehensive assessment. With this aim, we collected 300 blasting events with different parameters at the Sin Quyen copper mine (Vietnam), and the produced PPV values were also measured. They were then compiled as the dataset to develop the PPV predictive models. The results revealed that the bagging models provided better performance than the empirical models, except for the BA-DTR model. Of those, the BA-ExTree is the best model with the highest accuracy (i.e., 88.8%). Whereas, the empirical models only provided the accuracy from 73.6%–76%.

Efficient prediction of PTEs is difficult due to high spatial variability and multiple sources of contamination. The use of machine learning algorithms is an alternative for the improvement of the predictions. Objective of the study was to model the spatial distribution of PTEs in soils surrounding a tailings pile and to assess potential risks to human health. A total set of 116 soil samples was collected to a depth of 0–10 cm. The covariate database was composed of morphometric variables derived from a DEM and the creation of a tailings pile location covariate. The models tested were Cubist (CUB), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Linear Model (Lm). Based on the best predictive model, maps showing the spatial distribution, pollution and risk to human health were created. The SVM model had the best performance for predicting spatially the soil contents of Pb and Zn, with lower values of mean absolute error (MAE ? 744.71; 306.36) and higher values of R2 (0.56; 0.52). It was possible to verify that the mining tailings pile is the main source of Pb and Zn contamination in the study area. The enrichment factor (EF) and the geoaccumulation index (Igeo) of Pb and Zn show that the soils close to the tailings piles are extremely contaminated (Igeo &gt; 5 and EF &gt; 40), and pose risks to human health (Total carcinogenic risk &gt; 1 × 10–6), especially for children.

However, these single models have certain limitations, so this paper adopts a multi-model prediction method. First, ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is used to remove noise in ship motion data. Then the random forest (RF) prediction model optimized by genetic algorithm (GA), back propagation neural network (BPNN) prediction model and SVR prediction model are respectively established, and the final prediction results are obtained by results of three models. And the weights coefficients are determined by the correlation coefficients, reducing the risk of prediction and improving the reliability. The experimental results show that the proposed combined model EEMD-GARF-BPNN-SVR is superior to the single predictive model and more reliable.

Prediction of workpiece quality and cutting tool wear is an essential aspect in forecasting the performance of the micro-manufacturing machine tool in the field of smart manufacturing. Micro-structures of titanium alloys are widely used in next-generation vascular stents, drug-eluting stents, micro-opto-electromechanical systems, microfluidics and bio-micro-electromechanical systems. This study presents the development of machine learning (ML)-based models to predict the condition of the micro-turning machine tool. Coated carbide (CCMT060204LF KC5010) cutting inserts are readily used to machine the titanium Ti6Al4V alloy. To monitor vibration signals, a vibration sensor is positioned at the tooltip. The tool flank wear and the surface roughness of the machined component have been measured for each machining pass. The contribution of various parameters affecting surface roughness and flank wear has been studied. The experimental data consisting of vibration signal, speed, feed and depth of cut is used to train multiple ML models and thereby predict the surface roughness and tool flank wear. The Random Forest (RF) model is more accurate but takes longer to computations, whereas the Radial-based function is less accurate but takes less time. The Regression tree has a 7% lower accuracy than the (RF) model, but it is two times quicker. Given the importance of computation time and accuracy associated with various machine learning models, the regression tree performs better in predicting machine tool condition. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Machine learning models; Micro-turning; Surface roughness; Titanium alloy; Tool wear,Conference Paper,Scopus

The heart-lung sound (HLS) from the stethoscope is a mixture of heart sound (HS) and lung sound (LS). The first and most crucial step is to differentiate between HS and LS from the mixture signal. This paper proposes an unsupervised single-channel blind source separation (BSS) algorithm based on nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and deep learning (DL). Firstly, HS signals are extracted by the multi-constrained NMF (MCNMF) decomposition algorithm and K-means & SVM (KS) clustering method proposed in this paper, and different types of HS signals are classified by a convolutional neural network (CNN). Then, the HLS is separated by the embedding space centroid network (ECNet) proposed in our study. The method outperforms the known state-of-the-art techniques in all evaluation metrics SNR, SDR, SIR, SAR, and correlation coefficient. Our algorithm has two advantages: 1) this study is the first to combine NMF and DL for the HLS separation. MCNMF with selected constraints can have a more substantial sparsity effect that improves the decomposition accuracy. KS clustering algorithm can distinguish the HS component from the LS component in two clustering results. By mapping classified HLS into an embedding space, the ECNet demonstrates excellent separation results. 2) HS extraction and classification first, then HLS separation. Because our method exploits more detailed information from HS types in HLS before BSS, the ECNet can outperform other HLS separation methods. © 2022 The Authors",Cardiopulmonary disease; Deep learning; Heart and lung sound separation; Nonnegative matrix factorization,Article,Scopus

Predictive algorithm is a scientific idea of empirically establishing a relationship between the historical set of data which can then be used to make future decision in an attempt to solve some real-life problems. The action of predictive algorithm on big data results into predictive modeling which has been applied by various researchers to solve numerous problems including prediction of weather condition, rate of disease spread, birth rate, death rate, rate of road accident, and in population prediction too. In this paper, we have presented a comparative analysis on the performance of four major machine learning classification algorithms, namely K-nearest neighbor, naïve Bayes, random forest, and SVM on three case studies of predictive modeling using WEKA tool.

Traditional seizure detection is done by electroencephalography (EEG) technicians, which takes a lot of time. Therefore, this paper proposes a new method for automatic seizure detection. In this paper, we use multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) method for modal decomposition of multi-channel EEG signals and introduce dispersion index (DI) as a new brain network weight calculation method which is based on dispersion entropy (DE) to extract the features of single-channel temporal brain network and multi-channel spatial brain network for seizure detection. In single-channel temporal brain network, the network is constructed by weighted horizontal visibility graph (WHVG) method which considers the sample points as network nodes. In multi-channel spatial brain networks, DI is used to calculate the correlation between channels and select the threshold to construct the ternary-valued network of channels. We perform the validation on two publicly available datasets. The results show that the classification results for F1, AUC, ACC, PRE, SEN and SPE on CHB-MIT dataset are 97.89%, 97.81%, 97.83%, 97.56%, 98.24% and 97.39%, respectively.

The method proposed in this paper achieves good results on both datasets. In general, the joint detection of temporal and spatial networks is promising, and DI can serve as a valid indicator of correlation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Dispersion index; Multivariate variational mode decomposition; Seizure detection; Weighted horizontal visibility graph,Article,Scopus

Pests are also a major problem. Image Processing has evolved as an effective thing for the early analysis and detection of plant disease. Several algorithms have used to analyze the diseases at the early stage that results in minimum loss to the farmers and good quality of crops.

However, there still has no research about wind turbine vibration considering wake effect. Meanwhile, although previous research had reduced wind turbine vibration by installing dampers, there is still no systematic global optimization method for wind turbine damper. The question that whether optimized damper without consideration about wake effect can be directly applied in wind turbines affected by wake or not is still not clear. To this end, this study first investigates wake effect on downstream wind turbine vibration. Then, tuned mass damper and rotational inerter double tuned mass damper are installed in wind turbine tower to control tower vibration. Innovatively, this study proposes a global optimization method for dampers based on radial basis function neural network and genetic algorithm, which is significantly accelerated by GPU acceleration technology. As well, wake effect on wind turbine dampers is studied by comparing optimized dampers with and without consideration of wake.

Canadian insurers are facing natural disaster-induced claims of approximately $1 billion annually, whereas it was closer to $400 million in the previous decade. Moreover, annual national liabilities of the Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements have increased from $100 million annually in late 1990s to $500 million in 2009–2010 and reached approximately $2 billion in 2013–2014. To maintain their basic functions, Canadian cities have to maximize the resilience of their critical infrastructure systems under CID. In their previous work, the authors proposed a framework that focused on historical power outage data to quantify city resilience. The framework showed that CID are the main cause of power outages in North America. Subsequently, the aim of this work is to assess previous CID in an attempt to enhance the resilience of the power system as one of the most critical infrastructure systems in Ontario. The first part of this work involves employing descriptive data analysis to derive meaningful information from a CID database. Following that, an unsupervised machine learning technique will be employed to assess CID probability in Ontario on the spatial level. Finally, the resilience of hydroelectric power generators across Ontario will be deliberated based on the spatial analysis performed. This work is considered a step in CID assessment and prediction, based on historical hazard data, global climate models, and climate change measures, in an attempt to maximize city resilience and mitigate CID-induced risks on cities. © 2023, Canadian Society for Civil Engineering.",,Conference Paper,Scopus

It has threatened lives and livelihoods and triggered supply chain disruptions and economic crises. In every country, there are risks and long-term implications. Planners and decision-makers could benefit from a forecasting model that anticipates the spread of this virus, thereby providing insight for a more targeted approach, advanced preparation, and drive better proactive collaboration. The signs and symptoms of a disease like COVID-19 are hard to define and predict, particularly during times of pandemic. Several epidemiological studies have been successful in identifying predictors, using artificial intelligence (AI). This paper explores various methodologies for tuning the hyperparameters of the auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, using GridSearchCV, to predict and analyze the occurrence of COVID-19 in populations. In time series analysis, hyperparameters are crucial and the GridSearchCV methodology results in greater predictive accuracy. The parameters proposed for the analysis of daily confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deceased cases in India were ARIMA (4, 1, 5), ARIMA (5, 1, 1), and ARIMA (5, 1, 1), respectively. The performance of the model with different configurations was evaluated using three measurements: root mean square error (RMSE), R2 score, and mean absolute error (MAE). These results were compared with a state-of-the-art method to assess model selection, fitting, and forecasting accuracy. The results indicated accuracy and continuous growth in the number of confirmed and deceased cases, while a decreasing trend was graphed for recovered cases. In addition, the proposed ARIMA using a GridSearchCV model predicted more accurately than existing approaches. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",ARIMA; GridSearchCV; Hyperparameter tuning; Machine learning; Optimization; Prediction and analysis; SARS-CoV2,Conference Paper,Scopus

In the context of process data analytics, change points in the time series of process variables may have an important indication about the process operation. For example, in a batch process, the change points can correspond to the operations and phases defined by the batch recipe. Hence identifying change points can assist labelling the time series data. Various unsupervised algorithms have been developed for change point detection, including the optimisation approach which minimises a cost function with certain penalties to search for the change points. The Bayesian approach is another, which uses Bayesian statistics to calculate the posterior probability of a specific sample being a change point. The paper investigates how the two approaches for change point detection can be applied to process data analytics. In addition, a new type of cost function using Tikhonov regularisation is proposed for the optimisation approach to reduce irrelevant change points caused by randomness in the data. The novelty lies in using regularisation-based cost functions to handle ill-posed problems of noisy data. The results demonstrate that change point detection is useful for process data analytics because change points can produce data segments corresponding to different operating modes or varying conditions, which will be useful for other machine learning tasks. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

Extrapolation, prediction, and theoretical computational analysis of exogenous variables are approaches to the forecasting of population processes. Such methods can be exploited to predict individual birth preferences or experts’ views at the population level. Predicting demographic changes have been problematic while its precision usually depends on the case or pattern; numerous methods have been explored; however, so far there is no clear guidelines where the proper approach ought to be. Like certain fields of industry and policy, planning is focused on projections for the future composition of the population, the potential creation of population sizes and institutions which are significant. In order to recognize potential social security issues as one determinant of overall macroeconomic growth, countries that have reduced mortality and low fertility, the case with some of the Asian nations, desperately require accurate demographic estimates. This introduction provides a stochastic cohort model that uses stochastic fertility, migration, and mortality modeling approaches to forecast the population by gender and literacy. This work focus on the population and literacy ratio of India as this nation holds the second largest population in the world. Our approach is based on artificial neural network algorithm that can forecast the population literacy ratio and gender differences based on living states populations using social networks data. We concentrated primarily on quantifying future planning challenges as previous research appeared to neglect potential risks. Our model is then used to forecast/predict gender-wise population for each major state/city. The findings offer clear perspectives on the projected gender demographic composition, and our model holds high precision results. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Demographics; Machine learning; Neural network; Population forecasting; Social media,Conference Paper,Scopus

However, most current studies are fully data-driven and may contradict the underpinning physical knowledge. To address this issue, we propose a physically consistent framework for fatigue life prediction that uses a probabilistic physics-informed neural network (PINN) to incorporate the physics underpinning the fatigue mechanism. Particularly, we consider the scatter of the fatigue life using a probabilistic neural network with the output to parametrize the fatigue life distribution. Then use neural networks' inherent backpropagation capabilities to automatically compute the derivatives that represent the physical knowledge. Finally, construct a composite loss function to encode the derivatives with certain physical constraints and uses a negative log-likelihood function to consider both failure data and run-out data. This enforces the network training process to learn a continuous function that describes the stress-life relationship satisfying both experimental data and physical knowledge. We demonstrate the proposed framework with sensitivity analysis and a comparison to the fully data-driven neural networks and the conventional statistical methods using the fatigue test data of three different materials. The results show that the proposed framework has a robust performance to effectively reflect the underlying physical knowledge and prevent overfitting issues. The findings provide a better understanding of neural networks’ application to fatigue life prediction and suggest that one should be cautious when using a fully data-driven approach in scientific applications. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Fatigue life prediction; Physical knowledge; Probabilistic physics-informed neural network; Scientific machine learning; S–N curve,Article,Scopus

In order to minimize the seismic response of energy dissipation structure, many dampers installed at different positions are often necessary. The dynamic response of dampers at different positions is different in seismic action. Therefore, more than one damper needs to be tested physically in RTHT, and multiple dampers loaded by multiple actuators in real time will increase control difficulty. To solve this issue, an offline hybrid testing method for energy dissipation structure is proposed based on machine learning, which avoids the challenge of control and stability caused by real-time loading of multiple actuators in RTHT.

The local search is executed on the global best and makes use of a filter-based method, which then intends to take the advantage of the filter and wrapper methods. Our results exhibit that the proposed methodology can be successfully used to select fewer features and, at the same time, increase the classification efficiency over using all features. The proposed methodology also shows how well an evolutionary learning algorithm like the particle swarm optimizer can be used for search optimization of optimum features in the dataset. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Evolutionary learning; Feature engineering; Feature selection; Filter method; Machine learning; Particle swarm optimization; Wrapper method,Conference Paper,Scopus

The automatic fault detection of ball bearings and real-time system monitoring is also one of those application domains which aims at preventing unpredicted failures and unnecessary machine halts, without substantial human intervention. The rising needs with parallel efforts have led to the development of numerous machine learning (ML) techniques and investigative studies-related thereto. Studies on the influence of different sets of features for training classifiers and number of datasets, on the performance of different ML classifiers, are also available in abundance; however, none emphasizes the importance of sample size before extracting the feature vector, on determination of classification results and computational efficiency. Considering this, the present work intends to examine the effect of four different fault feature sets and the sample size, on the overall performance of k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithms with different kernel functions. For this, the signal was first preprocessed using wavelet packet transform (WPT), and the impulsive bands, having significant correlation with the raw signal, were combined, and the resultant wavelet coefficients were used for signal reconstruction. Next, a set of features comprising root mean square, kurtosis, spectral entropy, and Hjorth’s mobility and complexity parameters were extracted from the reconstructed signal for classification purpose. The maximum accuracies of 99.3% and 99.6% of fine KNN classifier with tenfold validation were achieved in case of samples with sizes 1024 and 4096 data points, respectively. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Artificial intelligence; Bearing diagnostics; Defect severity; Localized fault; Online condition monitoring; Rolling element bearing,Conference Paper,Scopus

The RT-PCR which is the test confirming if a person has Covid-19 infection, is restricted by the shortfall of reagents, time taking, high cost and need for dedicated labs with trained pathologists. With the sudden rise in daily cases, there were large queues for Covid-19 tests, stressing the medical laboratories with many such laboratories facing shortage of kits for testing.

However, due to the influence of complex environment, environmental noise is often doped, and the diagnostic accuracy is reduced. The traditional deep self-encoder is used in the noise reduction process of rotating machinery fault diagnosis. The pooling model is poor and easy to lead to over-fitting problems, and deep learning training needs a large number of labeled data. Therefore, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning fault diagnosis method based on less label data. The random pooling is used to replace the pooling layer of the original convolutional self-encoder, and the exponential linear unit (ELU) is used to replace the original activation function to enhance the convolutional self-encoder. A large number of unlabeled samples are used for training, and then the deep reinforcement learning is used for network fine tuning. The experimental results of the sensor data collected by the fault diagnosis test bench show that the method used has a good improvement in denoising ability and feature extraction ability, and the recognition accuracy and stability are better than traditional convolutional autoencoder and traditional machine learning methods. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Convolutional auto-encoder; Fault diagnosis; Reinforcement learning; Stochastic pooling,Conference Paper,Scopus

A MKFCNN-LSTM migration learning algorithm based on multi-kernel fusion convolution neural network (MKFCNN) and long and short time memory neural network (LSTM) is proposed to realize the fault diagnosis of wind turbine planetary gearbox. Firstly, the MKFCNN is constructed to extract the multi-scale spatial features of the sample signal, and then it is connected in series with LSTM to extract the corresponding time information of the sample signal. In view of the associated fault feature information between the rolling bearing data set and the planetary gearbox data set, the rolling bearing vibration signal of the Western Reserve University is input into the MKFCNN-LSTM as the source domain sample data, and iterative training is used to update the network weight and offset value. The pre-trained MKFCNN-LSTM is obtained, and then fine-tuned by inputting the vibration data of the planetary gearbox with small samples in the target domain, the weight and offset values are transferred from the source domain to the target domain, and finally the accuracy of fault recognition based on the number of small samples in the target domain is improved. The experimental results show that the proposed method can apply the original fault diagnosis knowledge to the vibration data set of the planetary gearbox in the laboratory.

Data protection laws are majorly about safeguarding the right to decide how the information is being used by the algorithm.

Building a surrogatemodel to approximate the behavior of structures instead of the exact structural analyses is a possible solution to tackle this problem. However, most existing surrogate models have been designed based on regression techniques. This paper proposes a novel method, called CaDE, which adopts a machine learning classification technique for enhancing the performance of the Differential Evolution (DE) optimization. The proposed method is separated into two stages. During the first optimization stage, the original DE is implemented as usual, but all individuals produced in this phase are stored as inputs of the training data. Based on design constraints verification, these individuals are labeled as ""safe"" or ""unsafe"" and their labels are saved as outputs of the training data. When collecting enough data, an AdaBoost model is trained to evaluate the safety state of structures. This model is then used in the second stage to preliminarily assess new individuals, and unpromising ones are rejected without checking design constraints. This method reduces unnecessary structural analyses, thereby shortens the optimization process. Five benchmark truss sizing optimization problems are solved using the proposed method to demonstrate its effectiveness. The obtained results show that the CaDE finds good optimal designs with less structural analyses in comparison with the original DE and four other DE variants. The reduction rate of five examples ranges from 18 to over 50%.

However, there is few novel feature extraction method integrating time-domain and space-domain features in emotion classification. This study explored the connectivity patterns between brain regions over functional connectivity brain networks in different frequency bands of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and proposed a novel feature extraction method to classify emotions, which provided a unique perspective on emotion recognition. We constructed phase locking value (PLV) matrices analyzed in different frequency bands. Then, three distance matrices, dF, dS, and dLE, were built using the corresponding three distance measures (the Frobenius norm, the spectral norm, and the log-Euclidean distance, respectively). And the complexity measures on those distance matrices were calculated. The distance matrices and complexity measures, as two features, were fed into the machine learning classifiers to validate the proposed method. Eventually, the dF matrix obtained an average classification accuracy of 83.96 % in the alpha band between positive and neutral emotions, the dLE matrix obtained an average classification accuracy of 84.12 % in the beta band between positive and negative emotions, and the dF matrix obtained an average classification accuracy of 83.56 % in the delta band between neutral and negative emotions. We conclude that the delta, alpha, and beta frequency bands correlate highly with emotions, and the brain's anterior and right temporal lobes are inextricably linked to emotions. In addition, the feature extraction method proposed in this paper can effectively improve the classification accuracy of emotions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Brain-computer interface (BCI); Classification; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Emotion recognition; Feature extraction; Functional brain network,Article,Scopus

The most effective tool for solving many problems in this area is using satellite data. The advent of optical satellites of high spatial resolution (Sentinel-2, Worldview-2,3) makes it possible to use modern methods of operational mapping to solve forestry problems (in particular, identifying burnt areas after a fire). As the monitoring area increases, and the number of images increases, the need for automatic data processing. Thereof to improve the accuracy of recognition of such objects in images is to use deep learning algorithms based on convolutional neural networks. This paper presents a description of the “traditional” methods for burned area detection (vegetation indices, multi-channel, and single-channel change detection, etc.), convolutional neural networks, and their main principles, and limitations.

An analytical review of modern methods for studying the evacuation flows movement parameters war carried out. Despite the availability of modern software-simulating complexes, the movement parameters of the evacuation participants for these complexes are determined by establishing relationships between the flow density and the speed of the evacuation participants. These dependencies can be identified mainly by the results of field observations and processing of video recordings of these observations, which takes a lot of time and requires a lot of effort and indicates the need for automation and optimization of the video processing process. The tools for analyzing and classifying images, as well as detecting and classifying moving objects in a video stream deserve special attention, as they can be successfully used to study the problems of evacuation in case of fire.

The proposed model makes it possible to process data from different types of sensors to solve classification and regression problems. The model has hierarchical structure consisting of three-level calculators, which allows it to be used in the edge computing approach and to process data from different types of sensors, with varying measures dimensions and frequency of new data. To form the input tensor of a hierarchical neural network model, an algorithm for pre-processing and formatting input data from measures of different sensor types is proposed, considering the spatial and temporal characteristics of the obtained measurements. Also a method of neural networks compression based on hidden layers neurons pruning is proposed. Suggested method implements an unified approach to the compression of convolutional, recurrent and fully connected neural networks to solve classification and regression problems. The core mechanism of the proposed method is based on the dropout operation, which is used as a technique of neural network regularization. The method estimates rational probability of hidden layers neurons dropout on the basis of the neuron excessiveness parameter, which is estimated with the help of a special “trimmer” network.

The paper considers the classification of time realizations subject to normal additive noise with different variances. The wavelet spectrum visualization for various wavelet functions is presented. A residual neural network was used for the classification of the spectra images. The computational experiment results give evidence that the classification based on the recognition of wavelet spectra images allows qualitative distinguishing signals with an additive noise component having different signal-to-noise levels.

Combining data and ML consequently enables continuous improvement that differs from conventional continuous improvement, especially in higher efficiency on default detection. However, scientific literature needs to be updated continuously. Hence, this work aims to gather research information on advancements in ML applications in organisations for continuous improvement purposes. Following the PRISMA Statement, 11 relevant articles were analysed. Results evidenced that most research is case-specific and focuses on applicability. Furthermore, it was observed that most papers are from the manufacturing industry. Although some theoretical research indicates the potential of ML applications in the operations domain (i.e., before and post-production processes), the literature in this segment is lacking. It can be concluded that the potential of ML in management systems is dependent on the amount and quality of data. However, this latter comes at a high cost and therefore, careful cost–benefit analysis should be made before adopting ML in businesses. Overall, this review provided promising perspectives for applying ML within quality systems and potential leading ways for continuous improvement in safety, environment and integrated management systems. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Artificial intelligence; Industry 4.0; ISO 9001:2015; Quality Control; Total quality management,Book Chapter,Scopus

These methods may be either evasion or malicious payload methods. Although there are several approaches to handle these methods for performing effective dynamic malware analysis, generally most of them are based on a manually created list. However, the performance shown by the selected approaches is based on the completeness of the manually created list that is not almost a complete and up-to-date one. Missing some sensitive methods causes to degrade the overall performance and affects the effectiveness of analyzing Android malware. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to predict new sensitive methods that might be used in Android malware. We use a manually collected training dataset to train two classifiers: the first one is used to detect the sensitivity nature of the Android methods, and the second one is used to categorize the detected sensitive methods into predefined categories. We applied the proposed approach to a large number of methods extracted from Android API 27. The proposed approach is able to predict hundreds of sensitive methods with the accuracy of 94.4% for the first classifier and 92.8% for the second classifier. To evaluate the proposed approach, we built a new list of the detected sensitive methods and used it in a number of tools to perform dynamic malware analysis. The proposed model found various sensitive methods that were not considered before by any other tools. Hence, the effectiveness of these tools in performing dynamic analysis is increased. © 2020 ISC.

A properly constructed perceptual system can effectively improve the intelligence level of the smart environment and optimise resource utilisation, minimising unnecessary waste by reducing the number of sensors. This paper will analyse how to build an optimal intelligent perceptual system for architectural spaces with the help of knowledge in human physiology, cognition, and information science. It will propose possible technologies and design strategies to improve the efficiency and accuracy of information perception in a built space through eight case studies and that the perception system in a smart environment consists of two levels: sensory and cognitive. The first level is the sensory level, that is, the information of the external environment is acquired through the sensory organs and is mapped from the external stimuli to the subject. To construct sensory-level perception in a smart environment, this paper adopts concepts from human physiology to build four categories of perceptual systems for architecture—visual, auditory, haptic, and olfactory-gustatory—and explores the possible ways to implement each system design with specific case studies. The second level is the cognitive level, that is, the sensory information obtained in the first level is analysed and processed by the brain to form meaningful signals or visual images, which are cognitively comprehensible to the subject. To better understand the users’ needs in the space, this paper advocates the construction of multidimensional information perceived on a multimodal sensory system as a way to enhance the cognitive ability of the built environment. We also introduce systematic methods for establishing multimodal sensory systems, design strategies for the spatial layout of various sensory systems, and applications of machine learning algorithms to understand environmental information of the users’ real-time demands. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Intelligent system; Interactive space; Multimodal; Perceptual system,Book Chapter,Scopus

The conventional machine vision-based tool condition monitoring (TCM) approaches cannot meet the high precision requirement in micro machining, as the cutting parameters are in micro scale and the spindle works in high rotation speed which makes online tool wear measurement quite difficult. To meet these challenges, this study develops a single image super-resolution (SISR) approach for direct tool wear estimation in micro-milling. Motivated by the self-similarity of tool wear image morphology, this study proposes a sparse decomposition framework by learning dictionaries from the tool wear image pyramid. Based on their multi-scale invariant properties, the similar image patches of coarse scales can be retrieved from fine scales to reconstruct the high-resolution image fastly and in high quality. The reconstructed high-resolution image then can be conveniently applied to wear monitoring, and overcomes the image acquisition deficiencies of the conventional machine vision-based monitoring approaches.

The current cuff-based BP monitoring methods are non-invasive but discontinuous while continuous BP monitoring methods are mostly invasive and can only be applied in a clinical setup to patients being monitored by advanced equipment and medical experts. Several studies have reported different techniques for predicting BP values from non-invasive Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Apart from BP readings, estimating ABP waveforms from non-invasive signals can provide vital body parameters such as Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) which can be used to determine poor organ perfusion, nutrient supply to organs, and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), etc. Methods: It is challenging to estimate ABP waveforms while maintaining a high BP prediction performance and ABP waveform pattern. In this work, we propose a novel approach for ABP waveform estimation by separating the task into BP prediction and a normalized ABP waveform estimation through segmentation from PPG, PPG derivatives, and ECG signals, and combining afterward. We propose the Nested Attention-guided BiConvLSTM Network or NABNet which uses LSTM blocks during segmentation for better handling of the existing phase shifts between PPG, ECG, and ABP signals. Several experiments were performed to improve the ABP reconstruction performance, which was combined with an existing BP prediction pipeline for the non-invasive estimation of ABP waveforms. Results: The proposed framework can robustly estimate ABP waveforms from PPG and ECG signals by reaching a high MAP performance and low construction error while maintaining the overall Grade A performance of the BP prediction pipeline. Conclusion: Linearly translating the range-normalized, synthesized ABP segments by corresponding SBP and DBP predictions from the BP prediction pipeline managed to robustly estimate ABP waveforms from PPG and ECG signals. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",1D-Segmentation; ABP Estimation; Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP); Bidirectional Convolutional LSTM; BP Prediction; Electrocardiogram (ECG); Guided Attention; NABNet; Photoplethysmogram (PPG); Signal Reconstruction; Signal to Signal Synthesis,Article,Scopus

There are different approaches to do this, namely analytical modeling and machine learning (ML) techniques. Machine learning requires large training sets and reliable features, nevertheless it can capture the interactions between architecture and software without manual intervention. In this paper, we compared a BSP-based analytical model to predict the time of execution of kernels executed over GPUs. The comparison was made using three different ML techniques. The analytical model is based on the number of computations and memory accesses of the GPU, with additional information on cache usage obtained from profiling. The ML techniques Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest were evaluated over two scenarios: first, data input or features for ML techniques were the same as the analytical model and, second, using a process of feature extraction, which used correlation analysis and hierarchical clustering. Our experiments were conducted with 20 CUDA kernels, 11 of which belonged to 6 real-world applications of the Rodinia benchmark suite, and the other were classical matrix-vector applications commonly used for benchmarking. We collected data over 9 NVIDIA GPUs in different machines. We show that the analytical model performs better at predicting when applications scale regularly.

However, participants who lack programming knowledge usually have difficulties understanding smart contracts by reading the source code. It brings them difficulties and risks when interacting with decentralized applications. Objective.: We aim to translate the smart contract source code into natural language descriptions as fine-grained in-line comments to help people better understand, learn and operate smart contracts. Method.: We propose an automated translation approach for smart contracts written in Solidity, termed SolcTrans, based on an Syntax Tree (AST) and formal grammar. We have investigated representative Solidity smart contracts, identified the AST parsing paths and core attributes used for translation, and proposed corresponding translation templates for special statements. Then, we leveraged reinforcement learning to train a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar-based syntax synthesizer used to generate comprehensible English sentences as comments. Result.: The experimental results show that SolcTrans outperforms four state-of-the-art neural machine translation models under currently available training data and is less affected by lengths of code snippets and translation outputs. We also conducted a human evaluation among 20 volunteers and asked them to score the generated comments. The results demonstrate that SolcTrans performs well on three metrics: Accuracy, Readability, and Instructiveness. Conclusion.: Our approach produces high-quality fine-grained comments for smart contract source code under the small training dataset, which creates a paradigm for future studies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Automatic comments generation; Machine translation; Reinforcement learning; Smart contract; Solidity,Article,Scopus

However, most of the current AI drug recommendations cannot give explainable inferences, where their prediction procedures are black boxes, and are difficult to earn the trust of doctors or patients. In explainable inference, the key steps during the recommendation procedures can be located easily, facilitating model adjustment for wrong predictions and model generalization for new drugs/samples. In this paper, we analyze the necessity of developing explainable AI drug recommendation, and propose an evaluation metric called traceability rate. The traceability rate is calculated as the proportion of correct predictions that are traceable along the knowledge graph in all the ground truths. We further conduct an experiment on a benchmark drug response dataset to apply the traceability rate as evaluation metric, where the results show a trade-off between model performance and explainability.

A numerous feature extraction with classification models were discussed previously about the lung disease, but those methods having high over fitting problem, consequently, decrease the accuracy of detection. To overwhelm this issue, a Deep Convolutional Spiking Neural Network optimized with Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm is proposed in this manuscript for Lung Disease Detection using Chest X-ray Images as COVID-19, normal and viral pneumonia. Initially, NIH chest X-ray image dataset is taken from Kaggle repository for detecting lung disease. Then, the chest X-ray images are pre-processed using the Anisotropic Diffusion Filter Based Unsharp Masking and crispening scheme for removing noise and enhancing the image quality. These pre-processed outputs are fed to feature extraction. In feature extraction process, the empirical wavelet transform method is used. These extracted features are given into Deep Convolutional Spiking Neural Network classifier (DCSNN) for detecting lung diseases. Here, the weight with bias parameter of DCSNN is enhanced based upon Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA), which improves detection accuracy. The simulation is executed in MATLAB. The proposed LDC-DCSNN-AOA technique attains higher accuracy, higher Precision, higher F-Score analyzed with the existing techniques, like Lung disease detection using Support Vector Machines optimized with Social Mimic Optimization (LDC-SVM-SMO), Lung disease detection using eXtreme Gradient Boosting optimized by particle swarm optimization (LDC-XGBoost-PSO), Lung disease detection using neuro-fuzzy classifier optimized with multi-objective genetic algorithm (LDC-NFC-MOGA), Lung disease detection using convolutional neural network optimized with Bayesian optimization LDC –CNN-BOA respectively. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Anisotropic Diffusion Filter Based Unsharp Masking and crispening; Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm; Chest X-ray images; Deep Convolutional Spiking Neural Network classifier; Empirical wavelet transform; Lung Disease detection,Article,Scopus

The Navier-Stokes equations describe fluid flows and are representative of nonlinear physical systems with complex spatio-temporal interactions. Fluid flows are omnipresent in nature and engineering applications, and their accurate simulation is essential for providing insights into these processes. While PDEs are typically solved with numerical methods, the recent success of machine learning (ML) has shown that ML methods can provide novel avenues of finding solutions to PDEs. ML is becoming more and more present in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). However, up to this date, there does not exist a general-purpose ML-CFD package which provides 1) powerful state-of-the-art numerical methods, 2) seamless hybridization of ML with CFD, and 3) automatic differentiation (AD) capabilities. AD in particular is essential to ML-CFD research as it provides gradient information and enables optimization of preexisting and novel CFD models. In this work, we propose JAX-Fluids: a comprehensive fully-differentiable CFD Python solver for compressible two-phase flows. JAX-Fluids is intended for ML-supported CFD research. The framework allows the simulation of complex fluid dynamics with phenomena like three-dimensional turbulence, compressibility effects, and two-phase flows. Written entirely in JAX, it is straightforward to include existing ML models into the proposed framework. Furthermore, JAX-Fluids enables end-to-end optimization. I.e., ML models can be optimized with gradients that are backpropagated through the entire CFD algorithm, and therefore contain not only information of the underlying PDE but also of the applied numerical methods. We believe that a Python package like JAX-Fluids is crucial to facilitate research at the intersection of ML and CFD and may pave the way for an era of differentiable fluid dynamics.

Nature of problem: The compressible Navier-Stokes equations describe continuum-scale fluid flows. These flows often involve highly complex flow phenomena such as shocks, material interfaces, and turbulence. The intrinsic nonlinear dynamics render the numerical simulation of the these equations challenging. Machine learning provides novel avenues for describing partial differential equations. Machine learning models rely on gradient information provided by automatic differentiation and are often implemented in Python. In contrast, existing high-performance computational fluid dynamics codes are typically written in Fortran or C++ and do not offer inherent automatic differentiation capabilities. These discrepancies hinder the advance of machine-learning-supported computational fluid dynamics. Up to this day, a general-purpose fully-differentiable computational fluid dynamics solver for compressible two-phase flows is missing. Solution method: We introduce JAX-Fluids: a general-purpose three-dimensional fully-differentiable computational fluid dynamics solver for compressible two-phase flows. JAX-Fluids is a simulation framework intended for machine-learning-supported computational fluid dynamics research. Our framework is written entirely in JAX, a high-performance numerical computing library with automatic differentiation capabilities. We have used an object-oriented programming style and a modular design philosophy. This allows the straightforward exchange of numerical methods. We provide a wide variety of state-of-the-art high-order computational methods for compressible flows. The modularity of our framework additionally facilitates the integration of custom subroutines. We use the sharp-interface level-set method to model two-phase flows. The software package can easily be installed as a Python package. We have build the source code around the JAX NumPy API. This makes JAX-Fluids accessible and performant. JAX-Fluids runs on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. We use HDF5 in combination with XDMF for writing output quantities. The Python packages Haiku and Optax are used for implementation and training of machine learning methods. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: JAX-Fluids relies on open-source third-party Python libraries. These are automatically installed. In the current version, JAX-Fluids only runs on a single accelerator (CPU/GPU/TPU). Future versions will include support for parallel execution. JAX-Fluids has been tested on Linux and macOS operating systems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Computational fluid dynamics; Differential programming; Level-set; Machine learning; Navier-Stokes equations; Turbulence; Two-phase flows,Article,Scopus

Existing methods (traditional risk adjustment algorithms, clinical observation, et.) use laboratory parameters requiring specialized biochemical analysis, which is difficult to obtain in the pre-hospital emergency setting and does not accurately predict the requirement for IMV. Methods: In this study, 20 non-invasive parameters including patient demographic parameters, physiological parameters, Glasgow score and ventilator parameters, were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database. A real-time early warning model of IMV requirement was developed using classical seven machine learning methods in different categories and compared with two traditional risk adjustment algorithms. Results: The prediction results using Lightgbm were 0.917 (95 %CI:0.914–0.922) for area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and 0.853 for accuracy (ACC) (95 %CI:0.850–0.856), outperforming the traditional risk adjustment algorithm, which were 0.615 and 0.533 respectively. The addition of invasive parameters increased the AUC value of the model by 0.009. Conclusions: A real-time early warning algorithm was developed in this paper for IMV requirement based on non-invasive parameters using seven learning methods, which proved to be superior to the traditional risk adjustment algorithm. Using real-time clinical data, the proposed algorithm can calculate current and future requirement for IMV requirement at any point in time during the stay of a patient in the ICU.

In order to extract general ECG representations that can be adapted to various downstream tasks, the learning process needs to be based on a general ECG-related task which can be achieved through self-supervised learning (SSL). However, existing SSL approaches either fail to provide satisfactory ECG representations or require too much effort to construct the learning data. In this paper, we propose the T-S reverse detection, a simple yet effective self-supervised approach to learn ECG representations. Inspired by the temporal and spatial characteristics of ECG signals, we flip the original signals horizontally (temporal reverse), vertically (spatial reverse), and both horizontally and vertically (temporal–spatial reverse). Learning is then done by classifying four types of signals including the original one. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we perform a downstream task to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) which is one of the most common ECG tasks. The results show that the ECG representations learned with our method achieve remarkable performance.

In order to achieve described purpose, this study uses three decision tree algorithms (random forest (RF), gradient boosted regression tree (GBRT) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB)) to build machine learning models, and utilizes the tree-structured parzen estimator (TPE) for farther improvement of models' performance. The influence of injector design parameters and injection conditions on spray characteristics was analyzed, basing on the constructed machine learning model. Finally, the spray characteristic map was made by predicting the spray characteristics under 1 million conditions, and the method of using the spray characteristic map to design the spray characteristics was proposed. The results have shown that TPE-GBRT has the most accurate prediction result for spray tip penetration (STP), and TPE-XGB has the most accurate result for spray downstream angle (SA_down). The feature importance analysis indicated the greater importance of the injection conditions over the injector design parameters for the spray characteristics. Further, by analyzing the spray characteristics map, the injection conditions have less design freedom, while injector parameters can assume different values to achieve the same spray characteristics. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Flash boiling spray; Gasoline direct injection; Injector hole parameters; Machine learning model; Model optimization,Article,Scopus

However, the nuclei in the tissue images obtained from different human organs are characterized with high variability in shape, size, morphology and spatial arrangements. Moreover, during digitization of tissue slide, the image quality is degraded because of added artifacts, poor contrast, blurred regions due to failed auto-focus and inconsistent staining procedure. Owing to these challenges, it is difficult to build a generalized feature representation that can achieve precise segmentation and classification of nuclei instances in complex tumor micro-environment of tissue specimens obtained from various organs. To address these problems, we propose a novel deep learning model, that harnesses horizontal and vertical distance information hidden among the nuclei instances to successfully delineate the challenging nuclei. Our proposed methodology uses soft attention mechanism to generate relevant feature activation and prune irrelevant and noisy information. These attention units produce more precise and refined feature maps resulting in finer instances segmentation and accurate classification in the overlapping nuclei, the nuclei with touching boundaries and reduction in false positives. We train our model on publicly available data-sets (Kumar, CoNSep, CPM-17 and a new data-set PanNuke). Our methodology shows superior performance in nuclei classification and segmentation in comparison with recently published methods.

Methods: We propose an unsupervised deep learning method that performs 2 tasks: registration and quantification for intravoxel incoherent motion–diffusion kurtosis imaging analysis. A common registration method in diffusion MRI is based on minimizing dissimilarity between various DWIs, which may result in registration errors due to different contrasts in different DWIs. We designed a novel unsupervised deep learning method for both accurate registration and quantification of various diffusion parameters. In order to generate motion-simulated training data and test data, 17 volunteers were scanned without moving their heads, and 4 volunteers moved their heads during the scan in a 3 Tesla MRI. In order to investigate the applicability of the proposed method to other organs, kidney images were also obtained. We compared the registration accuracy of the proposed method, statistical parametric mapping, and a deep learning method with a normalized cross-correlation loss. In the quantification part of the proposed method, a deep learning method that considered the diffusion gradient direction was used. Results: Simulations and experimental results showed that the proposed method accurately performed registration and quantification for intravoxel incoherent motion–diffusion kurtosis imaging analysis. The registration accuracy of the proposed method was high for all b values. Furthermore, quantification performance was analyzed through simulations and in vivo experiments, where the proposed method showed the best performance among the compared methods.

However, there are cases in which Human experts are needed to label the data, which may have a significant cost in terms of human resources and time. In these cases, it is often best to learn on-the-fly, without expecting for the whole data to be labeled. Often, it is desirable to guide the Human annotators into focusing on the more relevant instances: this constitutes the so-called active learning. In this paper we propose an approach in which a clustering algorithm is used to find groups of similar instances. Then, the procedure is guided with the objective of favoring the annotation of the groups that are under-represented in the labeled dataset.

Detecting corruption in public procurement is challenging because of imperfect corruption reg flags and vast number of tenders. Authorities need potent and scalable tools to identify corrupt public procurement practices. This paper shows that weak supervision machine learning algorithm provides a proficient method that can easily be implemented. Authorities can effectively calculate corruption probabilities of millions of public procurement tenders using the weak supervision algorithm. Weak supervision combines information contents of imperfect corruption red flags with unknown accuracies. Additionally, it can handle measurement errors. I analyze potential corruption in 25,859,734 European Union (EU) public procurement contracts in years 2009–2020 using the Snorkel weak supervision algorithm.

Many computer security incident response teams (CSIRT) and cybersecurity centers had reported significant behaviors of the attacks and they raised multiple warning signs, some of them being ignored by different third parties and others were taken into consideration and new frameworks started to be translated into research directions as a cross-collaboration between researchers and professionals. As a conclusion of CSIRTs, data science is the leader and gives the tone of the change. Identifying properly the security incident patterns or different types of insights within the cybersecurity data and implementing the right data-driven model, represents the main task is to achieve for an automated and intelligent security system. In this paper, we will propose a machine learning framework for cybersecurity, focusing on data science for cybersecurity, where the data collected from trusted sources t are relevant for cybersecurity. Our work will kickstart discussion on various research challenges which are open for improvements and will also point out the most challenging future research directions.

In this work, we attempted to automatically classify irises with machine learning models based on several different iris patterns in order to assist genetic research related to pigmentation and structural tissue differences within the human iris. Specifically, two main iris patterns that are commonly observed in the general population were analyzed: the Fuchs’ crypts and the peripupillary pigmented ring. A two-stage machine learning model was proposed to classify the iris crypt frequency, in which a Mask R-CNN model was first built to identify the number of crypts of each size level in the iris, followed by a SVM model to determine the final category. Another KNN model, which used the area-refined histogram features, was applied to classify the iris based on the peripupillary pigmented ring. The labels used in the images were generated independently by two trained expert raters. The performance of these models was evaluated on a test set with overall accuracies of the models estimated at 80.0% and 86.6% for crypts and pigmented ring, respectively. These optimized objective models were therefore concordant with the inter-rater reliability scores produced by expert human raters. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Iris classification; Iris pattern detection; Object detection,Conference Paper,Scopus

The control of time-delayed systems is particularly challenging. There are some heuristic methods that can be used in the time and frequency domain. These are, for example, those by Ziegler Nichols or Chien Hrones and Reswick. The parameters that were found with it result in asymptotically stable regulated systems. In most cases, however, they show transient behavior that still requires readjustment. This publication presents a table for PID parameters that can be used to control systems with time-delayed, stable step responses. This minimizes the common quality criteria in the time domain, IAE, ITAE and ISE. The determination of the parameter sets is very computationally intensive. Therefore, an approach from the field of artificial intelligence was chosen for their calculation. The application of the parameter sets found is verified using an example of the control of a liquid level. The parameter sets also take into account the controller output limitations that are relevant in practice.

With the utilization of blockchain, an emerging and swiftly developing technology, these problems can be efficiently solved.

It is difficult for the network parameters to adapt sentences with largely varied semantics or grammatical structures. To resolve this problem, we introduce a model that concentrates the each of the heterogeneous features in the input sentences. Build upon the encoder-decoder architecture, we design a latent-enhanced multi-filter seq2seq model (LEMS) that analyzes the input representations by introducing a latent space transformation and clustering. The representations are extracted from the final hidden state of the encoder and lie in the latent space. A latent space transformation is applied for enhancing the quality of the representations. Thus the clustering algorithm can easily separate samples based on the features of these representations. Multiple filters are trained by the features from their corresponding clusters, the heterogeneity of the training data can be resolved accordingly.

Additionally, IDS needs to detect previously unknown attacks that do not exist in its knowledge base. This capability is traditionally achieved by anomaly detection based on trends and baselines; an approach that is prone to high false-positive rates.

Weld area is often as an evaluation index of geometric characteristics to evaluate the welding quality since it has great effect on the mechanical properties of welded joints. In this paper, a prediction method of weld area based on process parameters is proposed for laser oscillation welding of 6061 aluminum alloy. From the metallographic micrographs of welding experiments, the cross-sectional area of weld is calculated by image recognition technology and the error of recognized weld area is less than 8.8%. Additionally, various prediction models for weld area under different process conditions are established by machine learning algorithms including linear regression, polynomial regression and back propagation neural network (BPNN). The established prediction models are compared by the mean square error (MSE) and coefficient of determination (R2). The results show that the BPNN prediction model indicates the highest accuracy and robustnessand can be adopted to predict the cross-sectional area of weld. The proposed method can be used for selecting the optimal process condition for the ideal welded joints with the desired weld geometry to improve the quality of laser oscillation welding. © 2022",Aluminum alloy; Image recognition; Laser oscillation welding; Machine learning; Weld area,Article,Scopus

However, pseudo-labeling-based semi-supervised approaches suffer from two problems in medical image datasets: (1) the models' predictions are biased toward the majority class in imbalanced datasets, and (2) discarding unlabeled data with confidence below the thresholds results in the loss of useful information. To solve these issues, we propose a novel SSL framework, FullMatch, which improves the model's performance by utilizing all unlabeled data. Specifically, we propose adaptive threshold pseudo-labeling (ATPL), a method for generating pseudo-labels based on the model's current learning status. ATPL dynamically adjusts the thresholds for each class during the training process, which can generate more pseudo-labels for classes with learning difficulties, thus alleviating the problem of data imbalance. Unlike existing semi-supervised methods based on pseudo-labeling, we do not discard unlabeled data with confidence below the thresholds. We propose an unreliable sample contrastive loss (USCL) to leverage useful information from unlabeled data with confidence below the thresholds by learning the similarities and differences between sample features. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conducted experiments on the ISIC 2018 skin lesion classification dataset and the blood cell classification dataset.

These are powerful tools that are capable of learning highly generalizable patterns from large datasets through millions of parameters. At the same time, their large capacity can render them prone to memorizing data points. Recent work suggests that the memorization risk manifests especially strongly when the training dataset is noisy, involving many ambiguous or questionable samples, and memorization is the only recourse. Objective: The goal of this paper is to evaluate and compare the extent of memorization and generalization in neural code intelligence models. It aims to provide insights on how memorization may impact the learning behavior of neural models in code intelligence systems. Method: To observe the extent of memorization in models, we add random noise to the original training dataset and use various metrics to quantify the impact of noise on various aspects of training and testing. We evaluate several state-of-the-art neural code intelligence models and benchmarks based on Java, Python, and Ruby codebases. Results: Our results highlight important risks: millions of trainable parameters allow the neural networks to memorize anything, including noisy data, and provide a false sense of generalization. We observed all models manifest some forms of memorization. This can be potentially troublesome in most code intelligence tasks where they rely on rather noise-prone and repetitive data sources, such as code from GitHub. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first study to quantify memorization effects in the domain of software engineering and code intelligence systems.

Experimental results on both simulated and real data revealed that the novel BFNs method was superior to other compared methods in connectivity, and the feature extraction scheme proposed performed well in predicting brain age.

Detecting the presence or potential heart disease of the fetus as soon as possible, and adopting relevant treatment plans in a timely manner, which has a profound impact on doctors and patients. This study aims to develop an accurate screening method with arrhythmia (ARR) to assist physicians to further diagnose whether them have heart disease. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-domain feature extraction technique and a hierarchical extreme learning machine (H-ELM) network for the prediction of fetal ARR. Firstly, the multi-domain feature extraction technology is used to extract abundant high-dimensional feature for representing the original signal. Secondly, neighborhood component analysis (NCA) is used to screen the sensitive features from the high dimensional feature vectors. Then, the obtained sensitive features are input into stacked extreme learning machine sparse autoencoder (ELM-SAE), which extract high-level fusion features by layer-by-layer unsupervised learning manner. Finally, an original ELM was connected on the end of the ELM-SAE network for the prediction of fetal ARR. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed method can achieve sensitivity of 99.11%, specificity of 93.91%, precision of 93.52%, and accuracy of 96.33%. Furthermore, the proposed method comprehensive performance outperforms the compared models. Therefore, the proposed method can be effectively used for the prediction of fetal ARR, and with the continuous improved the research, it is expected to be considered as an auxiliary diagnostic tool for physicians in the future. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Fetal ARR prediction; Hierarchical extreme learning machine; Multi-domain feature; NCA; Non-invasive fetal electrocardiography,Article,Scopus

Consistency regularization typically encourages a model to produce consistent predictions with the given training goals, while unreliability adaptation aims to learn the transition probabilities from model predictions to training goals, instead of enforcing their consistency. In this paper, we present a model of Collaborative learning with Unreliability Adaptation (CoUA), in which multiple constituent networks collaboratively learn with each other by adapting their predictions. Toward this end, an additional adaptation module is incorporated into each network to learn a transition probability from its own prediction to that of the paired network. Therefore, the networks can exchange training experience, without being overly sensitive to the unreliability of predictions. To further enhance the collaborative learning, each network is encouraged to produce consistent predictions with the consensus results, while being resistant to the adversarial perturbations against others. Therefore, the networks are able to mutually reinforce each other. We perform extensive experiments on multiple image classification benchmarks to verify the superiority of the co-adaptation based collaborative learning mechanism. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Collaborative learning; Image classification; Semi-supervised learning; Unreliability adaptation,Article,Scopus

The Fengfeng mine in Handan, North China has a 30-y history of coal mining with long-term mining activities and complex geological conditions, resulting in a complex hydrogeochemical environment in the mining region. In this study, the hydrogeochemical evolution mechanism of groundwater in a multi-aquifer system in the Fengfeng Mining Area was investigated using machine learning (self-organizing maps combined with K-means clustering) and sulfur and oxygen isotopes (?34SSO4 and ?18OSO4). The hydrogeochemical characteristics of different aquifers in the mining area changed to different degrees after mining compared with the characteristics before mining. The spatiotemporal variations in groundwater components were found to be controlled by pyrite oxidation, gypsum dissolution, and carbonate dissolution, which are affected by mining activities. Pyrite oxidation primarily occurred in the Carboniferous thin-layer limestone aquifer (CLA) and Permian sandstone aquifer (PSA). The hydrogeochemical evolution in the Ordovician limestone aquifer (OLA), the main aquifer in the study area, was affected by leakage recharge from CLA and PSA caused by mining activities. The results showed that owing to the effects of long-term mining, the altered groundwater flow system affected the evolution of groundwater components in each aquifer, particularly the sulfate concentration.

Concurrently, non-negligible biases of stock status estimated using data-limited methods are becoming an issue. It is well known that the assumed prior distribution on depletion for some data-limited methods strongly affects the estimated stock status. Priors on depletion are best set based on expert knowledge, however, expert subjectivity and experience should be considered. Moreover, for a very data-limited stock, there is no information from experts. Owing to such constraints, the blind application of “default priors” on depletion often takes place. Here, we examined fishery-related, model assumption-related, biology-related, management-related, and spatial-based characteristics of stocks in which such default priors tend to work well, and vice versa, by applying a machine learning method (XGBoost) to the RAM Legacy data. The results suggest that “false healthy” misclassification of stock status in Catch Maximum Sustainable Yield (CMSY) and Abundance Maximum Sustainable Yield (AMSY) methods occurs more for stocks that are less managed with short time series length with slow growth and less variation in recruitment. In contrast, “false overexploited” misclassification of stock status in CMSY and AMSY occurs more for stocks that are well managed, have long time series length, and high variation in recruitment. Filtering out non-suitable stocks based on such characteristics or correcting the bias using machine learning methods will prevent the blind application of default priors and may prevent misclassification of stock status for data-limited species. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",AMSY; CMSY; Data-limited; Machine learning; Stock assessment,Article,Scopus

The study period was separated into two phases (2013–2019 and 2005–2012) according to the availability of PM2.5 measurements. First, we trained models with two strategies of choosing time windows to compare model performance in predicting PM2.5 from 2013 to 2019, when measurements were available.

This work develops an accurate, fast, reliable end-to-end traditional machine learning (ML) model that can be implemented in real-time computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) applications for DFU diagnosis. We selected the plantar thermogram database because it may help detect an increase in plantar temperature and thereby permit early diagnosis. This method is less affected by environmental conditions, such as smoke and weather. To extract features invariant to translation, rotation, and scaling transformation, we use the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) methods combined with the Bag Of Features (BOF) technique. We used different pretrained deep learning (DL) networks to compare ML models trained with DL and handcrafted features. This research is novel since no previous studies have used traditional ML algorithms for the diagnosis of DFU from thermal images, nor have they used SIFT, SURF, or BOF techniques. In addition, we use direct temperature files of each foot, later mapping them onto images to obtain accurate temperature distributions. Conventional ML classifiers are preferred in the final stage for binary classification between normal and DFU. The proposed model achieves 97.81% classification accuracy using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier trained with the SURF-BOF technique, along with 97.81% sensitivity, 97.9% precision, and a 0.9995 Area under the ROC curve (AUC) for DFU classification using thermal images. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Bag of Features; Classification; Computer-Aided Diagnosis; Deep Learning; Diabetic Foot Ulcer; Machine Learning,Article,Scopus

The rotating machines fault diagnosis methods integrating vibration signal monitoring and deep learning provide reliable operation support solution for NPPs equipment. However, the inconsistent data probability distributions at different power levels limit the application of traditional models, which is a practical and neglected problem. To enhance the model generalization ability when the data are inconsistent, a deep transfer learning method based on hybrid domain adversarial learning (HDAL) strategy is proposed. First, the time–frequency domain features are extracted from the three-channel monitoring signals and fused into RGB images. Then, the deep convolutional network is applied to adaptively extract transferable features. More significantly, the transfer learning approach with an improved adversarial training strategy is implemented to more fine-grained reduce feature discrepancy, accordingly diagnosing faults under target power level. Finally, the general characteristics of typical faults are comprehensively captured based on rotating machines operation experiments, which provide data support for case testing. The comparative test and feature visualization verify the superiority of the proposed method, demonstrating the potential application value in NPPs rotating machines. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Fault diagnosis; Generative adversarial network; Nuclear power plant; Objective function optimization; Rotating machine,Article,Scopus

Rapid diagnosis, initiation of treatment, reduction of mortality and prolongation of lifespan are important. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is an important determinant of HF, especially in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF, LVEF ? 40 %) and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF, LVEF ? 50 %). LVEF is a measure of the amount of blood pumped out of the ventricle in one heartbeat. HFrEF is easier to diagnose since LVEF ? 40%. However, the diagnosis of HFpEF is difficult even for some specialists, since LVEF is 50 % or higher also in a healthy person. LVEF is measured by echocardiography which is an expensive device and requires a specialist. There may be situations where access to the device is limited. Some invasive and laborious blood tests are also used for diagnosing HF. As an alternative diagnostic method, a new machine learning-based diagnostic algorithm was developed for diagnosing HF and its subtypes using photoplethysmography (PPG). PPGs from volunteers were cleaned with digital filters. Then HRVs were derived from PPG and features were extracted from both PPG and HRV. Features were reduced by statistical methods. The classification was done with three different machine learning algorithms. The evaluation was made with 10-fold cross validation and maximum performance parameters: accuracy %87.78, sensitivity 0.87 and specificity 0.94. With this triple classification, it is determined not only whether the individual has an HF, but also which HF is present. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Artificial Intelligence; Classification; Heart Failure; HFpEF; HFrEF; Machine Learning; Photopletismography,Article,Scopus

The present work has tried to simplify this complicated procedure by proposing reliable and new correlative methods for determining thermodynamic and transport properties of four refrigerating substance classes, namely halocarbon, inorganic, hydrocarbon, and cryogenic fluids. New machine learning methods e.g., particle swarm optimisation adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (PSO-ANFIS), genetic programming (GP), and hybrid adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (Hybrid ANFIS) algorithms were utilised. The development of a new, simple and comprehensive correlation was for the first time introduced to estimate saturated vapour enthalpy, entropy, velocity of sound, and viscosity of refrigerants without having in-depth knowledge of complicated parameters. The accuracy and validity of the proposed models were assessed using a variety of statistical and graphical demonstrations. The findings were compared, and it was found that Hybrid ANFIS models are more accurate because Absolute Average Relative Errors (%AARD) for enthalpy, entropy, the velocity of sound, and viscosity were estimated as 0.5558, 1.3105, 0.5215, and 1.5727 in respective order. In addition, the proposed models' results were compared to the results of recently previously published models, and it confirms the reliability of our results.

Repeated structuring & learning procedure (RS&LP) is a constructive algorithm able to automatically create artificial neural networks (ANN); it relies on three parameters, namely maximal number of hidden layers (MNL), initializations (MNI) and confirmations (MNC), arbitrarily set by the user. The aim of this study is to evaluate RS&LP robustness to varying values of parameters and to identify an optimized combination of parameter values for HF diagnosis. To this aim, the Leiden University Medical Center HF database was used. The database is constituted by 129 serial ECG pairs acquired in patients who experienced myocardial infarction; 48 patients developed HF at follow-up (cases), while 81 remained clinically stable (controls). Overall, 15 ANNs were created by considering 13 serial ECG features as inputs (extracted from each serial ECG pair), 2 classes as outputs (cases/controls), and varying values of MNL (1, 2, 3, 4 and 10), MNI (50, 250, 500, 1000 and 1500) and MNC (2, 5, 10, 20 and 50). The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic did not significantly vary with varying parameter values (P ? 0.09). The optimized combination of parameter values, identified as the one showing the highest AUC, was obtained for MNL = 3, MNI = 500 and MNC = 50 (AUC = 86 %; ANN structure: 3 hidden layers of 14, 14 and 13 neurons, respectively). Thus, RS&LP is robust, and the optimized ANN represents a potentially useful clinical tool for a reliable automatic HF diagnosis. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Artificial Neural Network; Deep Learning; Heart Failure; Machine Learning; Repeated Structuring and Learning Procedure; Serial Electrocardiography,Article,Scopus

Traditionally, cloud data on Mars has been extracted through manual or semi-automated processes which can be time consuming, and currently there is limited spatial and temporal cloud data coverage. In this paper we demonstrate the successful use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract cloud masks from Mars Daily Global Maps (MDGMs) composed from the Mars Color Imager (MARCI) on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). The fully automated model reports an F1 score of 0.7925 compared to the prior semi-automatic technique, and in some occasions the model performs better at extracting the full extent of the cloud. We also introduce several image pre- and post-processing techniques to improve the model's performance and usability. The model is configured to provide cloud masks at 0.1° longitude by 0.1° latitude resolution. It also automatically bounds the MDGM by northern and southern polar extents depending on solar longitude. The results suggest that our deep learning model is a useful tool to automatically and quickly extract Martian water ice cloud masks and make it possible to generate cloud mask data across the complete set of MDGMs and future ones. The model and related techniques also have potential extensions to Martian dust storm identification.

The loss of smell is one of the first symptoms that come into prominence in the early diagnosis of PD. The main motivation of this study is to provide a more accurate diagnosis in the early period of the disease using chemosensory electroencephalography (EEG) signals, which are difficult to study and also less studied. For this purpose, we proposed a hybrid feature extraction method called EEMD_VAR that combines Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and Vector Autoregressive Model (VAR). In contrast to conventional feature extraction methods, the proposed method is to prevent arbitrary selection of features and to determine the number of features. The pre-processed EEG signals were decomposed using EEMD and the obtained intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) used as independent variables in VAR. The coefficients of the VAR model were employed as features in frequently used supervised classification algorithms. The performance metrics of the EEMD_VAR were compared to the performance metrics of the autoregressive (AR) model and Hjorth parameters. The maximum classification accuracy of the proposed method was 100% using artificial neural networks (ANN) in C2 electrode, while the AR method and Hjorth parameters only obtained a maximum of 72%. The other metrics also corroborate the proposed method's ability to perform well in the classification. In addition, the higher results from right side electrodes may lead to the conclusion that the right side of the brain is more sensitive to odor stimuli. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Chemosensory; Classification; Electroencephalogram; Feature extraction; Parkinson's disease,Article,Scopus

The computational effort is usually unbearable, especially for small failure probability. This paper proposes a new reliability analysis method combining relevance vector machine and subset simulation importance sampling, which guarantees the accuracy of results and improves the computational efficiency. In this method, relevance vector machine is first applied to approximate relatively coarse limit states. Then, subset simulation importance sampling is executed based on the constructed relevance vector machine. To improve the prediction accuracy, samples from first and last level are used to refine relevance vector machine. Since only the samples of last level are involved in the calculation of the failure probability, and the updated relevance vector machine has a very high prediction accuracy for the samples of last level, the obtained failure probability is extremely accurate. In addition, the samples are predicted by the well-constructed relevance vector machine rather than evaluated with real performance functions, which drastically decreases the calculation time. To reduce redundant iterations in the update process, a novel learning function based on the current design of experiment position and a stopping condition based on error estimation of reliability prediction are employed. Furthermore, the K-means clustering algorithm is utilized to implement the ability of surrogate model-based subset simulation importance sampling to handle multiple failure mode problems. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are verified by four examples involving different types of features. © 2022",K-means clustering algorithm; Relevance vector machine; Reliability analysis; Small failure probability; Subset simulation importance sampling,Article,Scopus

Thirdly, an ensemble learning algorithm consisting of three individual learning algorithms namely Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is used in the classification stage to predict conditions of PV systems based on a weighted voting approach. Moreover, we apply a genetic algorithm to optimize the weights assigned to the algorithms in order to detect electrical faults in PV systems with higher accuracy.

This study aims to present a deep forecasting model based on optimized (Gated Recurrent Unit) GRU neural network to predict rainfall in Pakistan based on the 30 years of climate data from 1991 to 2020. The climatic variables were first extracted and then fine-tuned by eliminating outliers and extreme values from the data set for precise forecasting. Data normalization strategies were further utilized to adjust numeric values into a standard scale without distorting divergences or losing useful information. The proposed model achieved high prediction accuracy by maintaining minimal Normalized Mean Absolute Error (NMAE) and Normalized Root Mean Squared Error (NRMSE) compared to state-of-the-art rainfall forecasting models. Climatic variables used in the forecasting were evaluated in terms of correlation and regression analysis. The correlation results showed that temperature has a negative association and air quality variables have a positive association with rainfall in each quarter of the year. The second and third quarters of the year showed a high association with rainfall, whereas the air quality variables showed a lesser or no association with rainfall during the first and second quarters of the year. The results further showed a strong association of climatic variables with rainfall for all months of the year. The minimal loss achieved by the proposed model also demonstrated the feasibility of selected variables in precise forecasting of rainfall regardless of volatile climatic conditions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Climate change; Crop productivity; Deep learning techniques; GRU; Rainfall forecasting,Article,Scopus

The Golmud River watershed is a representative alpine watershed in Northwest China, and it was chosen to explore groundwater chemistry, associated controlling factors, source contributions, and potential health risks. The analysis includes the use of a self-organizing map (SOM), positive matrix factorization (PMF), ionic ratios, and a Monte Carlo simulation. The content of total dissolved solids in phreatic water was higher in the dry season and increased from the mountainous zone to the fine-soil plain-overflowing zone. Additionally, the water type varied from HCO3? to Cl? types whereas confined groundwater was chemically stable and of a HCO3? type. The SOM results showed a visual correlation between the ions in groundwater. The combination of SOM, PMF, and ionic ratios identified water-rock action as a dominant factor of groundwater chemistry. It was also found that Clusters I and III were mainly influenced by silicate weathering (a total contribution of 38.4 %), whereas evaporation was dominant in Cluster VI (a contribution of 32.5 %). Anthropogenic pollution was mainly associated with clusters V and IV and was related to industrial and agricultural activities during the snowmelt and wet seasons, and fluorine deposition formed by residential coal heating during the dry season (contributions of 1.4 % and 23.8 % in Clusters V and IV, respectively). The sudden increases in B3+ and Li+ in Cluster II were due to inputs from small tributaries (a contribution of 3.9 %). The probabilistic health risk assessment showed that fluoride posed a greater non-carcinogenic risk to human health than Sr2+, B3+, and NO3?, and its potential threat to children was more significant during the dry season than in other seasons. It is necessary for local governments to establish urgent fluoride emission control policies within the Golmud River watershed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Anthropogenic effects; Golmud River watershed; Groundwater chemistry; Health risk evaluation; Rock weathering; Self-organizing map,Article,Scopus

However, none of these studies proposes machine learning models that investigate the regional heterogeneity of travel behaviours. To address this gap, this study develops a Random Effect-Bayesian Neural Network (RE-BNN) framework to predict and explain travel mode choice across multiple regions by combining the Random Effect (RE) model and the Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN). The results show that this model outperforms the plain Deep Neural Network (DNN) regarding prediction accuracy and is more robust across different datasets.

Special attention is paid to phase predictions, planar-defect calculations, and plastic deformation simulations. Next, we review ML models for macro-scale properties, such as lattice structures, phase formations, and mechanical properties.

The non-contact measurement method can avoid these problems. In this paper, a non-contact blood glucose detection method based on a near-infrared camera is proposed. Blood glucose has a strong absorption capacity in the near-infrared band, and other components in blood (water, hemoglobin, etc.) have different absorption characteristics in this band compared with blood glucose. Therefore, in this method, we realize blood glucose detection by receiving the near-infrared light reflected back after blood glucose absorption. We extracted 26 pulse wave features from the pulse wave and analyzed 6 that were highly correlated with blood glucose. Then, four kinds of machine learning algorithms (PCR, PLS, SVR, RFR) were used to build models respectively, and the RFR with the best performance was selected to build the final blood glucose prediction model. Finally, the experimental results are analyzed by Clark error grid analysis, which shows that the proposed method is in good agreement with the reference glucose monitor. Compared with traditional invasive blood glucose detection methods, the non-contact blood glucose detection method has more application prospects. © 2022",Blood glucose; Imaging photoplethysmography (IPPG); Machine learning; Near-infrared light,Article,Scopus

In the world of Internet of Things (IoT), the available hardware with low-power consumption is often microcontrollers. However, one of the challenges for embedding machine learning on microcontrollers is that the available memory space is very limited, and this memory is also occupied by the rest of the software elements needed in the IoT device. The problem is then to design ML architectures that have a very low memory footprint, while maintaining a low error rate. In this paper, a methodology is proposed towards the deployment of efficient machine learning on microcontrollers. Then, such methodology is used to investigate the effect of using compression techniques mainly pruning, quantization, and coding on the memory budget. Indeed, we know that these techniques reduce the model size, but not how these techniques interoperate to reach the best accuracy to memory trade-off.

This paper presents a supervised method for looking at tweet sentiments. Sentiment analysis by means of electronic media, for instance, Twitter has gotten a crucial and testing task. Because of the attributes of such information such as tweet length, spelling mistakes, abbreviations, and special characters, the sentiment analysis task in such an environment requires a non-conventional approach. Twitter posts are generally short and generated constantly by public and very well-suited for opinion mining. These messages can be elegant as containing either positive or negative sentiment on the basis of specific viewpoints with respect to a term-based query. The previous investigations of sentiment classification are not very conclusive about which features and supervised classification algorithms are good for designing precise and efficient sentiment classification system.

This requires a new innovative approach, one capable of forecasting of mood states, in particular manic one. In our recent work, we combined several data sources to extract the most relevant variables, describe its intrinsic dynamics by network-flow analysis, and apply several supervised machine learning models to predict mania in BDD. By applying several methods of extracting and selecting the features from those aggregated data, and consequently performed supervised machine learning we arrived at real personalized medicine approach to BDD forecasting. Here we are interpreting previously unpublished data on sleep-related variables and its possible relation with irritability that was the most promising variable from daily self-report data. By putting this connection in the perspective of other recent neuroimaging and biochemical findings we are elucidating on another most important factor, namely the reason why some antidepressants shown to disrupt sleep dynamics can exacerbate the tipping point to mania, via the already mentioned link between sleep-related variables and irritability that our research demonstrated to be of most valuable predictable power. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Bipolar depression; Forecasting; Mood disorders; Personalized medicine; Sleep-related variables,Conference Paper,Scopus

Classical game theory fails to correctly predict the probability of successful coordination due to its inability to prioritize salient Nash equilibrium points (in this setting, also known as “focal points”). To bridge this gap a variety of theories have been proposed. A prominent theory is the level-k theory which assumes that players’ reasoning depth relies on their subjective level of reasoning. Previous studies have shown that there is an inherent difference in the coordination ability of individual players, and that there is a correlation between the individual coordination ability and electrophysiological measurements. The goal of this study is to measure and quantify the electrophysiological sensitivity patterns in level-k states in relation to the individual coordination abilities of players. We showed that the combined model capabilities (precision and recall) improve linearly depending on the player’s individual coordination ability. That is, player with higher coordination abilities exhibit a more pronounced and prominent electrophysiological patterns. This result enables the detection of capable coordinators based solely on their brain patterns. These results were obtained by constructing a machine-learning classification model which predicting one of the two cognitive states, picking (level-k = 0) or coordination (level-k &gt; 0), based on electrophysiological recordings. The results of the classification process were analyzed for each participant individually in order to assess the sensitivity of the electrophysiological patterns according to his individual coordination ability. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Classification; EEG; Level-k; Tacit coordination; Transfer learning,Conference Paper,Scopus

To detect fraudulent accounts, previous works have exploited supervised machine learning algorithms. We can identify two main approaches. The first approach consists in representing transaction records as a graph in order to apply node embedding algorithms. The second approach consists in calculating statistics based on the amount and time of transactions realized. The former approach leads to better results at this day. However, transactional data approaches - based on time and data only - are not used to their full potential. This paper adopts a transactional data approach by expanding feature calculation to every transaction properties. We study three classification models: XGBoost, SVM Classifier and Logistic Regression and operate a feature selection protocol to highlight the most significant features. Our model results in a 26 features dataset providing an f-score of 0.9654. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Ethereum; Feature selection; Fraud detection; Machine learning; XGBoost,Conference Paper,Scopus

Motivated by such behavioral tendencies, the purpose of this study is to define an approach to automatically classify the tweets on Twitter data into two main classes, namely, hate speech and non-hate speech. This provides a valuable source of information in analyzing and understanding target audiences and spotting marketing trends. We thus propose HiSAT, a Hierarchical framework for Sentiment Analysis on Twitter data. Sentiments/opinions in tweets are highly unstructured-and do not have a proper defined sequence. They constitute a heterogeneous data from many sources having different formats, and express either positive or negative, or neutral sentiment. Hence, in HiSAT we conduct Natural Language Processing encompassing tokenization, stemming and lemmatization techniques that convert text to tokens; as well as Bag-of-Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) techniques that convert text sentences into numeric vectors. These are then fed as inputs to Machine learning algorithms within the HiSAT framework; more specifically, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Naïve Bayes are used as text-binary classifiers to detect hate speech and non-hate speech from the tweets. Results of experiments performed with the HiSAT framework show that Random Forest outperforms the others with a better prediction in estimating the correct labels (with accuracy above the 95% range). We present the HiSAT approach, its implementation and experiments, along with related work and ongoing research. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Bayesian models; Knowledge discovery; Logistic Regression; NLP; Opinion mining; Random Forest; Social media; Text mining,Conference Paper,Scopus

Our solution takes an input image of a scene like an empty balcony or a room and provides us a 2D floor mapping of the space. Using transfer learning, a custom trained semantic segmentation model is used to identify the objects in images. The outcome of semantic segmentation model is used by our custom algorithm to determine the empty floor space in an image and segment the area into restricted and non-restricted regions. The restricted segments, like the pathway in-front of the doors, furniture etc., are the ones that should be kept empty for people to move around easily. The non-restricted floor area can be utilised for a wide number of use-cases like design recommendations, autonomous robot navigation, empty parking space identification etc. This paper mainly deals with the balcony garden design recommendation, however as mentioned the same approach can be extended to other spaces. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2D space; Computer vision; Floor mapping; Recommendation system; Transfer learning,Conference Paper,Scopus

This is a dynamic equilibrium. An amount is projected for power demand based on historical patterns. This demand estimation will assist the system operator in determining how much electricity to deliver to meet demand or decrease waste. Demand appears to fluctuate over time, requiring supply to be adjusted correspondingly. Traditional fossil-fired power plants have a far simpler time adjusting their output than wind power plants. The output of thermal power plants can be programmed to respond to variations in demand. Wind power, like most other forms of renewable energy, is subject to unpredictable swings. Wind electricity, unlike natural gas power plants, cannot be sent. The maximum wind power output is mostly determined by the current wind conditions.

This study mainly compared the three-dimensional space, the tongue pronunciation range skewness, and the articulatory pronunciation time between dysarthria speech severity and control speech.

Next, an experiment with multiple autoencoders trained on each specific work point and running in parallel is reviewed. It is shown that, in this case, the minimum value of RMS error among all autoencoders should be taken as HI. Furthermore, it has been shown that there is a near-linear relationship between HI and the difference between measured and reconstructed angular-frequency waveforms. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Autoencoders; Condition-based monitoring; DC motors,Conference Paper,Scopus

A large population of interconnected devices (i.e. Internet of Things (IoT)) acting as local learners optimize the model parameters collectively (e.g., neural networks’ weights), rather than sharing and disclosing the training data set with the server. FL approaches assume each participant has enough training data for the tasks of interest. Realistically, data collected by IoT devices may be insufficient and often unlabeled. In particular, each IoT device may only contain one or a few samples of every relevant data category, and may not have the time or interest to label them. In realistic applications, this severely limits FL’s practicality and usability. In this paper, we propose a One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL) framework considering a FL scenario wherein the local training is carried out on IoT devices and the global aggregation is done at the level of an edge server. Moreover, we combine model-free reinforcement learning with OSFL to design a more intelligent IoT device to infer whether to label a sample automatically or request the true label for the one-shot learning set-up. We validate our system on the SODA10M dataset. Experiments show that our solution achieves better performance than DQN and RS benchmark approaches. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Federated learning; Internet of things; Model-free reinforcement learning; One-shot learning,Conference Paper,Scopus

A security breach in a healthcare network might directly result in the death of patients, the Internet of Things (IoMT) necessitates enhanced protection. A botnet is a collection of internet-connected devices used to carry out security breaches, leak sensitive information, and give botnet attackers control over IoMT devices. Malware distributed via botnets often includes network communication features that allow attackers to connect with other threat actors via the botnet’s vast network of infected devices. Using the UNSW-NB15 Dataset, we proposed a ESLRFBM (Efficient and Secured LASSO and RFBM) model for predicting botnet attacks in an IoMT scenario. In the UNSW-NB-15 dataset, we employed the embedded feature selection methods LASSO and RIDGE to detect botnet attacks. To detect security concerns, the IOMT has evolved and used machine learning technologies. We created and evaluated performance metrics such as Hamming loss and AUCROC scores using both classic and hybrid classifiers. By comparing and analysing the results using LASSO and RFBM properties, we can determine that our described model performs better. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Botnet Attacks; DoS; Health care systems; IoMT (Internet of Medical Things); LASSO; RIDGE; Security,Conference Paper,Scopus

These technologies have applications in improving the welfare of epileptics, epilepsy being a common neurological condition that can result in premature death without a quick response. As such it is important for the system to avoid false negatives. This investigation focused on how machine learning algorithms can be utilised to identify these events through Electroencephalography (EEG) data. The UCI/Bonn dataset, a classic benchmark for automated epilepsy detection systems was identified and utilised. This investigation focused on the random forest algorithm. Given that EEG neurological data represents time series data and machine learning excels at this task, automation could be achievable via a wearable device. From there, Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) were applied to identify if spectral features of EEG signals would aid identification of seizures. This method achieved an accuracy of 99%, precision of 98% and a recall of 100% in 12.2 ms time to classify and one second of EEG data.

We chose the four-tier nursing care category as the outcome variable. In this paper, we compare traditional tree-based machine learning models with approaches based on neural networks. The developed tool achieves a weighted average F1 score of 73% for a three-class COVID-19 severity forecast. We show that the complete blood count test can form the basis of a convenient and easily accessible method of predicting COVID-19 severity. Of course, such a model requires meticulous validation before it is proposed for inclusion in real medical procedures. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Computer-aided diagnosis; COVID-19; Deep learning,Conference Paper,Scopus

One application area that could benefit from such advancement is Electronic Skin systems, that are employed in several domains such as: wearable devices, robotics, prosthesis, etc. An e-skin system demands hard constraints including real-time processing, low energy consumption, and low memory footprint. This paper presents a tiny Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architecture suitable for the deployment on an off-the-shelf commercial microcontroller in compliance with the e-skin requirements. The training, optimization, and implementation of the proposed CNN are presented. The CNN implementation is optimized through layer fusion and buffer re-use strategies for efficient inference on edge devices. As a case study, experimental analysis of a touch modality classification task demonstrates that the proposed CNN-based system is capable of processing tactile data in real-time directly near the source while reducing the model size by up to 65% with respect to comparable existing solutions. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Convolution Neural Networks; Electronic skin; Microcontrollers; Tactile processing; Tiny ML,Conference Paper,Scopus

Embedding signal pre-processing methods (i.e., filters) along with processing algorithms (i.e., machine learning) into miniaturized electronic units enhance the extraction of high-bandwidth information (e.g., slippage detection). However, it is challenging due to the high computational costs and the real time requirements. This paper proposes a lightweight implementation of pre-processing method for multichannel tactile sensing system. We targeted two filtering methods, Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Exponential Moving Average Filter (EMAF). The paper presents the analysis of the implementation performance on hardware i.e., number of clock cycles, execution time and touch detection accuracy. Experimental results show that EMAF is more effective than FIR when it comes to the hardware complexity. This means that the computational cost for implementing such pre-processing filter is negligible and thus acceptable for time, and hardware constraint tactile sensing system. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Embedded implementation; Filtering methods; Signal processing; Tactile sensing system,Conference Paper,Scopus

A typical TC failure is the False Occupancy (FO), i.e., a TC results occupied for a certain period of time when there is no train on it. FO can be resolved by manually driving a train on the faulty TC with a waste of time and resources. After a FO, operators, based on their experience, need to decide if there is an actual need for maintenance or if the problem is due to other temporary causes. In this paper, we propose a Simple Informed Machine Learning (ML) based model able to automatically prescribe maintenance after a FO fully leveraging on the operator experience. However, ML models in modern industrial MLOps pipelines demand continuous data collection, model re-training, testing, and monitoring, creating a large technical debt. In fact, one of the main requirements of these pipelines is to not be regressive, i.e., not simply improve average performance but not introduce mistakes previously not present (negative flips). In this work we face this problem by empowering the proposed ML with Non Regressive properties.

Analyzing their structure and classifying them is a useful approach in the field of cyber security to detect anomalous commands used by malicious actors. Without any contextual knowledge, commands’ analysis is a difficult task as similar-looking commands might be performing different tasks, and commands with different aliases might be performing the same tasks. To understand command-line commands’ structure and their syntactic and semantic meanings, we created a rule-based system based on expert opinions. Using this system, we classified command-line commands into similar and not-similar classes. This rule-based system transformed command-line commands’ data into a binary classified form. We trained three machine learning models (a logistic regression document classifier, a deep learning document classifier, and a deep learning sentence-pair classifier) to learn the set of rules created in the rule-based system. We used Mathews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) score for the models’ performance comparison. The logistic regression model shows an MCC score of 0.85, whereas both the Deep Learning (DL) models scored above 0.98. DL document classifier and DL sentence-pair classifier achieved an accuracy of 0.943 and 0.983 respectively on unseen data. Our proposed hybrid approach solves the complex problem of classifying semi-natural language data. This approach can be used to create a domain-specific set of rules, and classify any semi-natural language data into multi-classes. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Command-line commands; Document classification; Hybrid approach; Machine learning; Rule-based system; Sentence-pair classification,Conference Paper,Scopus

However, most models use supervised methods while others use unsupervised methods, with less effective outcomes than supervised learning methods. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel level set loss function for unsupervised tasks and incorporates it with the Active Contour loss for supervised tasks. Besides, since previously introduced deep learning models generate less accurate results due to the intensity inhomogeneity issues and the often presence of low-intensity contrast tissues in infant brain segmentation, we propose a new convolutional neural network model to alleviate this problem. Instead of binary segmentation, our proposed loss entitles our model to segment multiple classes with promising outcomes. The proposed technique is utilized to segment neonatal brain magnetic resonance images into four non-overlap regions. The iSeg-2017 challenge, which offers a collection of neonatal brain magnetic resonance images from different sites, is used to evaluate our proposed process. The experiment demonstrates that our new loss function achieves promising results among the 21 participating teams.

In this paper, we aim to detect human eye infections of Glaucoma disease by firstly using different machine learning (ML) classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Na?ve Bayes (NB), Multi-layer perceptron (MLP), Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF), and secondly a Deep Learning (DL) model such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on Resnet152 model. The evaluation of the proposed approach is performed on the Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition dataset. The obtained results showed that the RF and MLP classifiers achieved the highest accuracy of 77% in comparison to the other ML classifiers. On the other hand, the deep learning model (CNN model: Resnet152) provides an even better accuracy of 84% for the same task and dataset. Furthermore, we observe our best performing model produce competitive results in comparison to some state-of-the-art approaches. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Deep learning; Eye detect; Glaucoma disease detection; Images recognition; Machine learning; ODIR,Conference Paper,Scopus

Feature selection is a popular machine learning method in which subsets of the data’s available features are chosen for use in a learning algorithm. The remaining, insignificant dimensions are removed from the most excellent feature, which has the fewest number of dimensions that contribute the most to precision. The goal of the selection of features is to choose a subset of info factors by eliminating characteristics that have practically or no prognostic value. Strategies for choosing elements can be partitioned into three categories. Filter strategies are one, Wrapper techniques are another, and Embedded strategies are the third. Our main goal is to develop a subset feature for autism spectrum disorder premature prediction using several wrapper-based feature selection algorithms. Autistic is a group of neuro-developmental disorders characterized by societal communiqué difficulties, restricted interests and activities, and abnormal tactile sensitivities. This study looks into the use of wrapper features selection techniques such as sequential forward selection (SFS), sequential backward selection (SBS), Sequential Backward Floating Selection (SBFS), Sequential Forward Floating Selection (SFFS), and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) as well as optimal selection approaches based on classifiers like RF, GBC, and CART. According to this study, the search methodology employing RFE based on the RF algorithm outperformed other methods in terms of average accuracy of 87%. The advantage of selecting feature subsets is that they are more accurate and take less time to run. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",ASD; Feature selection; Wrapper-based technique,Conference Paper,Scopus

Traditionally, counter-air-defense mission effectiveness (ME) is achieved through a combination of high quantities, low radar cross section (RCS), high speed, low altitude, and/or electronic attack. In the absence of any of these force multipliers, cooperative swarming tactics can be leveraged to achieve ME. This domain presents a highly complex state-action space compared to other more constrained rule-based games where ML agents have been successful in learning gameplay strategies. The approach taken in this research is to develop highly semantic observation and action functions, interfacing the cognitive agent behavior function to the gameplay environment, which is trained through repeated gameplay. The observation and action function designs of a cognitive CM agent are proposed and the framework described is used to train the agent as well as evaluate ME. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed agent is capable of learning highly effective, swarm-enabled tactical behaviors maximizing mission effectiveness and leveraging traditional optimizations such as RCS reduction, where a non-cognitive agent is unable to do so. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Destruction of enemy air defenses; Machine learning; Swarming autonomy,Conference Paper,Scopus

The second one focuses on the analysis method, implementing machine learning algorithms to maximize the information obtained from each single sensor to distinguish gases based on their interaction kinetics with the sensor.

After the feature elimination, the ensemble learning model (ELM) was trained to obtain a high-precision model for predicting life cycle carbon emissions (LCCE), life cycle costs (LCC), and indoor discomfort hours (IDH). Then, the optimal optimization algorithm was selected among three different optimization algorithms. Finally, the best building scheme was chosen according to the newly proposed solution. The results showed that the ELM could achieve high prediction efficiency by combining input feature evaluation and screening, multi-sampling methods, and hyperparameter optimization. The R2 value of ELM can reach 0.980, while the Two-Archive Evolutionary Algorithm for Constrained multi-objective optimization (C-TAEA) was the optimal optimization algorithm. The best equilibrium solution proposed in this study solved the problem of different optimization ranges of different objectives and maximized the optimization value. Finally, the best equilibrium scheme reduced the LCCE by 34.7%, the LCC by 13.9%, and the IDH by 26.6%.

In this paper, we investigated the patterns of intercity patient mobility and factors influencing this behavior based on >4 million hospitalization records of patients with chronic kidney disease in China. To provide practical policy recommendations, a role identification framework informed by complex network theory was proposed considering the strength and distribution of connections of cities in mobility networks. Such a mobility network features multiscale community structure with “universal administrative constraints and a few boundary breaches”. We discovered that cross-module visits which accounted for only 20 % of total visits, accounted for >50 % of the total travel distance.

Whilst the pH response upon acid/base addition to a mixture containing a single buffer can be described by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, modelling the pH response for multi-buffered poly-protic systems after acid/base addition, a common task in all chemical laboratories and many industrial plants, is a challenge. Combining predictive modelling and experimental pH adjustment, we present an active machine learning (ML)-driven closed-loop optimization strategy for automating small scale batch pH adjustment relevant for complex samples (e.g., formulated products in the chemical industry). Several ML models were compared on a generated dataset of binary-buffered poly-protic systems and it was found that Gaussian processes (GP) served as the best performing models. Moreover, the implementation of transfer learning into the optimization protocol proved to be a successful strategy in making the process even more efficient. Finally, practical usability of the developed algorithm was demonstrated experimentally with a liquid handling robot where the pH of different buffered systems was adjusted, offering a versatile and efficient strategy for a pH adjustment processes. © 2022 The Authors",Active machine learning; Buffered systems; Closed-loop optimization; pH adjustment,Article,Scopus

This subjective method suffers from numerous typical problems. The only solution to these problems is to design and implement objective methods for this. However, most of the existing works in this regard are based on machine learning frameworks that are semi-automated and feature-dependent. In this work, a deep learning-based fully automated, and single-stage framework is proposed to detect psoriasis lesions and measure their area score from color images of human body regions. Methods: The proposed method is an extension of the existing PsLSNet proposed by our team, which provides a fully automated approach for the segmentation of single psoriasis lesions from cropped patches of skin images. For this proposed work, a new version PsLSNetV2 model is developed for automated segmentation of healthy skin, multiple psoriasis lesions, and background region simultaneously in complete body region images. This proposed model utilizes an efficient and lightweight network with transfer learning to increase the representational efficiency for multi-class segmentation. Results: The proposed model is tested by 5-fold cross-validation on a self-generated dataset having 500 images from 100 psoriasis patients. The multi-class segmentation performance of the proposed model achieves an overall Dice-Coefficient Index and Jaccard Index of 97.43% and 95.05% respectively and outperforms the existing models. Conclusion: The fully automated multi-class segmentation results by the proposed lightweight segmentation model are promising enough to determine psoriasis area score objectively with an average accuracy of 94.20% for assisting dermatologists in a simple and rapid way. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Deep Learning; Image Segmentation; PASI area; Psoriasis; Transfer Learning; U-Net,Article,Scopus

MPCAM based on MPGAN (Multi-PSF Generative Adversarial Network) is first proposed to automatically extract multiple PSFs (point spread functions) and realize high fidelity image reconstruction by features fusion. The proposed end-to-end generative image fusion network is flexible and can be designed with different input dimensions for a given AF application, which is vital to circumvent the trade-off between DOF and SNR. We build a dataset containing 5000 raw images tailored to the proposed network by an off-the-shelf camera. Results show that our MPCAM system can produce images with average higher values than raw images over 4.625, and 0.061 in PNSR (peak signal to noise ratio), and SSIM (structure similarity) metrics, respectively. Moreover, compared to the classic and latest image fusion methods, the results also verify that our method has achieved comparable or even better performance.

Early and accurate diagnosis of NSCLC is crucial for the follow-up treatment, which is helpful in improving the survival time and quality of life of patients. Machine learning methods based on gene expression profile data provide a new way for the early diagnosis of NSCLC. However, there are a few difficulties in practical application: data noise, overlapping gene grouping, and the importance evaluations for gene groups and individual genes. This paper aimed to deal with these problems by developing an adaptive group lasso regularized multinomial regression (AGLRMR). Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) was presented to separate clean data from noisy gene expression profile data of NSCLC. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was adopted to perform overlapping gene grouping. The importance evaluation criteria for individual genes and gene groups were proposed by fusing module membership, information theory, and symmetric uncertainty. Compared with RAMRSGL, AMRSOGL, MSGL, MRGL, and MR-lasso, AGLRMR improved the diagnosis accuracy of NSCLC by 1.2%, 2.3%, 2.2%, 2.5%, and 4.0% on NSCLC-1 dataset, and by 1.1%, 8.7%, 6.2%, 7.1%, and 16.3% on NSCLC-2 dataset, respectively. The operation speed of AGLRMR is consistent with AMRSOGL and slower than the other four methods. Biological analysis showed that the genes selected by AGLRMR were highly correlated with NSCLC. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Adaptive group lasso; Gene screening; Multinomial regression; Non-small cell lung carcinoma,Article,Scopus

Thus, a key question for psycholinguistic research is how and why producers make the lexical selections that they do. Information theoretic approaches have argued that producers regulate the uncertainty of the utterance for comprehenders, for example using longer words like chimpanzee if their messages are likely to be misunderstood, and shorter ones like chimp when the message is easy to understand. In this work, we test for the relative contributions of the information theoretic approach and an approach more aligned with psycholinguistic models of language production. We examine the effect on lexical selection of whole utterance-level factors that we take as a proxy for register or style in message-driven production accounts. Using a modern machine learning-oriented approach, we show that for both naturalistic stimuli and real-world corpora, producers prefer words to be longer in systematically different contexts, independent of the specific message they are trying to convey. We do not find evidence for regulation of uncertainty, as in information theoretic approaches. We offer suggestions for modification of the standard psycholinguistic production approach that emphasizes the need for the field to specify how message formulation influences lexical choice in multiword utterances. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Language production; Lexical selection; Neural network; Reduction; Surprisal,Article,Scopus

We identify the best survey questions based on how well they predict a benchmark measure of the concept derived from qualitative interviews. We apply the method to create a survey module and index for women's agency. We measure agency for 209 married women in Haryana, India, first, through a semi-structured interview and, second, through a large set of close-ended questions. We use qualitative coding methods to score each woman's agency based on the interview, which we use as a benchmark measure of agency. To determine the close-ended questions most predictive of the benchmark, we apply statistical algorithms that build on LASSO and random forest but constrain how many variables are selected for the model (five in our case). The resulting five-question index is as strongly correlated with the coded qualitative interview as is an index that uses all of the candidate questions.

Several computational models have been proposed to explain context-dependent encoding, including reference point centering and range adaptation models. The former assumes that outcomes are centered around a running estimate of the average reward in each choice context, while the latter assumes that outcomes are compared to the minimum reward and then scaled by an estimate of the range of outcomes in each choice context. However, there are other computational mechanisms that can explain context dependence in RL. In the present study, a frequency encoding model is introduced that assumes outcomes are evaluated based on their proportional rank within a sample of recently experienced outcomes from the local context. A range-frequency model is also considered that combines the range adaptation and frequency encoding mechanisms. We conducted two fully incentivized behavioral experiments using choice tasks for which the candidate models make divergent predictions.

Detecting and diagnosing the DR remains a major question in this task. This developed work uses a robust hybrid binocular Siamese with a deep learning approach to classify the DR image. Initially, a pre-processing stage is introduced to remove unwanted noises. To perform this cross guided bilateral filter (CGBF) approach is emphasized. After the pre-processing, the feature extraction stage is presented to extract the features from the processed image. A wavelet-based Chimp optimization algorithm (WBCOA) is established for the extraction of features. After feature extraction, segmentation of optical disc (OD) and blood vessel (BV) is done via open closed watershed management (OCWSM). For the classification, binocular Siamese based AlexNet and GoogleNet with the SVM model are proposed in this work. The segmented OD and BV are input to the proposed hybrid DL network. Finally, the extracted images are fused and classified using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. The proposed method is implemented in Python and tested on DIARETDB0 (DB0) and DIARETDB1 (DB1) datasets.

It allows the detection of system faults and estimation of its remaining useful life (RUL) to anticipate failures and schedule appropriate prescriptive maintenance actions. Moreover, with the development of data acquisition tools in such industries, it is possible to collect large amount of data from similar systems, which prompts the use of machine learning algorithms for efficient estimation of the system RUL. However, due to different type of faults and degradation rates that can occur in real processes, there exists high variability of the end-of-life (EoL) time of each system degradation trajectory, making more difficult to fix a failure threshold and consequently generate several uncertainties in the estimation of RUL. To address this situation, this paper proposes a new data-driven approach for estimating the system RUL when dealing with the variability of degradation trends and unknown failure thresholds. Particularly, the proposed approach combines two RUL techniques, recursive and direct RUL estimation. First, the historical collected raw data are fed into a processing algorithm to construct prognostic health indicators (HIs) and choose the one that characterizes well the system's degradation trajectory. This latter indicator allows identifying the high and low EoL amplitude values from the historical data and is used to build a recursive prediction model that estimates in long-term the degradation trend evolution. After that, the trained model forecasts every degradation trend which EoL amplitude is less than the predefined high value. Thus, a set of possible RULs of each trajectory can be predicted. Finally, the ensemble of the derived RULs and their HI trajectories are fused to directly estimate the final RUL.

Using simulation techniques to customize medication response predictions to identify the optimal medication holds enormous potential for improving a patient’s probability of successful treatment. Unfortunately, the statistical effort of forecasting medication reaction is extremely difficult, partly due to dataset limitations and also due to algorithms flaws. Medications are organic molecules that are ingested by humans as well as cause a response in the body through engaging to target proteins. These medications can reduce positive or negative effects inside the organisms. The undesirable modifications in medications cause adverse reactions inside the human organism generally referred to as medication side effects. Such adverse effects might vary from mild occurrences like a migraine to more significant ones involving heart failure, malignancy, or perhaps even mortality. The medications are put through a series of tests in the laboratories to see if they have any negative health effects. Such tests, unfortunately, are both expensive and time-consuming. Numerical techniques can be used as a replacement for experimental research. Numerous computational strategies for detecting drug adverse reactions have recently been published. In this paper, several existing techniques of drug response prediction are surveyed. The Pearson correlation coefficient value of existing techniques is compared graphically and find that SRMF technique had attained the best results. The existing methods are examined with the help of various databases. The most essential databases for drug adverse reactions prediction are BIO-SNAP, SIDER, DART, etc. The sets of data associated with drug adverse reactions, as well as the parameters used to evaluate drug adverse events prediction techniques, have been described. For the evaluation of drug adverse reactions prediction techniques PCC, precision, accuracy, etc., parameters are used. For the prediction of drug side effects, several methods are used such as docking-based methods, network-based methods, machine learning-based methods, and various miscellaneous methods. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Docking based; Drug response prediction; Machine learning-based prediction methods,Book Chapter,Scopus

Aging and heavy usage of roads results in deterioration of the surface. Besides potholes, we also see many cracks in roads which may expand and develop into potholes themselves. Potholes can result in vehicle damage and can also cause physical harm to people in their vehicles. Detected potholes, if integrated with information systems, can notify drivers in real time, so they can be aware. Potholes are a problem, especially in developing countries. In this paper, we discuss leveraging and integrating the best modern technologies in order to solve this problem. We have tried to make it a feasible, robust, flexible, and modular system to help solve this problem. Using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and machine learning/deep learning and networking together, we will be able to spot potholes and cracks on the roads much faster than existing methods. By using the system, the need for manual surveillance is reduced. Using a UAV, you can cover large areas. To detect potholes, a UAV will be used to take videos and take pictures along the roads. These images will be sent to a computer where ML algorithms will detect the pothole. In addition to the CNN, a transfer learning algorithm and YOLO real-time object detection can be used to identify potholes. Video is streamed securely over Wi-Fi by an RTSP server to a local workstation, so the user can view the video from the UAV and may store it for future use. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Convolutional neural networks; Inception-V3; Potholes; QUIC; Road safety; RTSP; UAV; YOLO,Book Chapter,Scopus

In this context, usage of machine learning has become an important step forward in improving state of the art in bug detection. It is an artificial intelligence-based (AI) approach that makes it more effective due to the bulk of software modules. Many existing methods strived to incorporate ML for bug discovery. However, there is need for improvement with appropriate methodology. In this paper, we proposed a methodology that exploits two ML techniques known as decision tree (DT) and random forest (RF) for efficient means of discovering bugs from software modules. An empirical study is made using Python data science platform.

Until now, the machine learning approach is still very suitable for overcoming problems in text classification and improving accuracy for hate speech detection. However, the quality of the varying datasets caused the identification and classification process to remain a problem. Classification is one solution for hate speech detection, divided into three labels: Hate Speech (HS), Non-HS, and Abusive. The dataset was obtained by crawling Twitter to collect data from communities and public figures in Indonesia. The optimization process of the classification algorithm is carried out by comparing the SVM algorithm, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and RandomSearchCV. The experiment was carried out through two stages of activity: the classification algorithm using SMOTE and without SMOTE with Stratified K-Fold CV algorithm. The highest performance accuracy with SMOTE is obtained at 90.7% with the SVM model. Whereas without SMOTE, the highest performance accuracy uses the SVM with a value of 87.8%. Furthermore, with the addition of the Stratified K-Fold CV algorithm for non-SMOTE, the train_score is 97.4%, and the test_score is 95.2%.

This paper presents the implementation of a machine learning model of short and medium term hourly energy production of photovoltaic panels in BIPV buildings on several sites. We selected the data influencing the energy efficiency of the PV panels, with the measurement of variable importance score for each model. Indeed, we have developed and compared several machine learning models of hourly prediction independently of the building location taking into account the weather forecast data on site such as DHI, DNI and GHI and the same in clear sky condition. Five methods are tested and evaluated to determine the best prediction: Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Trees regression (DTR), and linear regression.

The kinds of decisions and predictions made by these machine-learning-enabled systems become much more profound and, in many cases, critical to students’ professional success. Various higher education institutions rely on machine learning to drive their strategy and improve their students academic success. Therefore, the need to trust these machine learning-based systems is paramount, and building a model that educational decision-makers who may not be familiar with machine learning can understand is critical. But sometimes, even for the experts in machine learning, it becomes difficult to explain certain predictions of the so-called “black box models”. Therefore, there is a growing need for easy interpretation of a complex black box model. Therefore, this study aims to provide a framework for an interpretable student performance model by introducing a local model-agnostic interpretability method shap value, which is a novel explanatory technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful way by opening the black -box model and explaining how the final result came out and which parts of the model are responsible for certain predictions.

To increase that accuracy, we can first use data preprocessing techniques and select the best attributes and then use all well-known ML models and select the accurate model from the existing one. We propose the process to select model for predicting rainfall using machine learning techniques in India. Here, we will perform the visual examination of distinct data variables to uncover all the patterns using data exploration techniques. To analyze rainfall trends, scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, box plots, and heatmaps are used. Multiple linear regression, support vector regression, random forest regression, lasso regression, and ridge regression are five regression models that can be used to model data.

We argue that database systems with SQL are capable of executing machine learning pipelines aswell as discovering technical biases-introduced by data preprocessing-efficiently. Therefore, we present a set of SQL queries to cover data preprocessing and data inspection: During preprocessing, we annotate the tuples with an identifier to compute the distribution frequency of columns. To inspect distribution changes, we join the preprocessed dataset with the original one on the tuple identifier and use aggregate functions to count the number of occurrences per sensitive column. This allows us to detect operations which filter out tuples and thus introduce a technical bias even for columns preprocessing has removed. To automatically generate such queries, our implementation extends the mlinspect project to transpile existing data preprocessing pipelines written in Python to SQL queries, while maintaining detailed inspection results using views or common table expressions (CTEs). The evaluation proves that a modern beyond main-memory database system, i.e. Umbra, accelerates the runtime for preprocessing and inspection.

Based on the packet reception rate, we use supervised machine learning approaches to forecast the performance of the CSMA/CA MAC protocol in this study. Our method consists of three steps: data gathering trials, offline modeling, and performance assessment. According to our findings, the XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) prediction model is the most effective supervised machine learning approach for improving network performance at the MAC layer. In addition, we explain predictions using the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) approach. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",MAC protocols; Machine learning; Shap value; Wireless sensor networks,Book Chapter,Scopus

The use of a pin for user authentication is a common method used in most of the systems such as locking and unlocking of private devices and doors. With an ever increasing network standards like 5G, new processes and procedures having less controlled environments, it is becoming an easy opportunity for a hacker to carry out the malicious attacks on the credentials of a person like bank details, organizational confidential information which use password-based system and are easy to hack and leak the confidential information. Password-based attack is where a person tries to hack a person’s password such as phishing attack, wherein a trustworthy person sends a fraudulent email or message, man-in-the-middle attack, brute force attack. Hence, a stronger password-based system needs to be designed to avoid such cybercrimes, which motivates for the implementation of this proposed work. This work proposes an eyeblink-based cyber-secure PIN password authentication system that uses blinking eye in the successive frames of an image captured for creating a PIN password. Virtual keypad is used by the user to enter his/her sensitive input; this virtual keypad uses orientation of eyes, gazing position on the virtual keypad screen. Captured information has been processed using machine learning and image processing algorithms for effective authentication. Implementation results have shown the strength of this proposed password system and its effective application avoiding the most frequent slippery slopes and follow-up attacks. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Eye tracking; Eyeblink; Image processing; Machine learning; Pin; User authentication and password security,Book Chapter,Scopus

The appropriate use of wearing a mask is a normal part of our life. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been emerging and circulating around the world throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. To minimize the risk of transmissions, the use of face masks or coverings has been recommended in public settings. Many countries and local jurisdictions encourage or mandate the use of face masks by members of the public to limit the spread of the virus. Masks are also strongly recommended for those who may have been infected and those taking care of someone who may have the disease. In this paper, novel face mask detection on masked face data set is done by using pretrained Xception, deep learning with depth wise separable convolution. The proposed method classifies from the given face image, mask is worn or not. The proposed method is tested and validated using the face mask data set obtained from Kaggle. This data set contains about 503 face images with mask and 503 images without mask.

The main difference between the two types is that in isolated sign language, the hand signs cover individual letters of the alphabet. In continuous sign language, entire words’ hand signs are used. This paper will explore a novel deep learning architecture that will use recently published large pre-trained image models to quickly and accurately recognize the alphabets in the American Sign Language (ASL).

Several medical imaging techniques have been used to analyze brain tumors, including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic reso-nance imaging (MRI). CT provides information about dense tissues, whereas MRI gives information about soft tissues. However, the fusion of CT and MRI images has little effect on enhancing the accuracy of the diagnosis of brain tumors. Therefore, machine learning methods have been adopted to diagnose brain tumors in recent years. This paper intends to develop a novel scheme to detect and classify brain tumors based on fused CT and MRI images. The proposed approach starts with preprocessing the images to reduce the noise. Then, fusion rules are applied to get the fused image, and a segmentation algorithm is employed to isolate the tumor region from the background to isolate the tumor region. Finally, a machine learning classifier classified the brain images into benign and malignant tumors. Computing statistical measures evaluate the classification potential of the proposed scheme. Experimental outcomes are provided, and the Enhanced Flower Pollination Algorithm (EFPA) system shows that it out-performs other brain tumor classification methods considered for comparison. © 2023, Tech Science Press.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) image-based fire detection systems can be a viable solution to this problem. However, these automatic systems use advanced deep learning and image processing algorithms at their core and can be tuned to provide accurate outcomes. Therefore, this article proposed a forest fire detection method based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture using a new fire detection dataset. Notably, our method also uses separable convolution layers (requiring less computational resources) for immediate fire detection and typical convolution layers. Thus, making it suitable for real-time applications. Consequently, after being trained on the dataset, experimental results show that the method can identify forest fires within images with a 97.63% accuracy, 98.00% F1 Score, and 80% Kappa. Hence, if deployed in practical circumstances, this identification method can be used as an assistive tool to detect fire outbreaks, allowing the authorities to respond quickly and deploy preventive measures to minimize damage. © 2023, Tech Science Press.

Because of the direct impact on the company revenues, particularly in the telecommunication sector, firms are needed to design effective CCP models. The recent advances in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models enable researchers to introduce accurate CCP models in the telecommunication sector. CCP can be considered as a classification problem, which aims to classify the customer into churners and non-churners. With this motivation, this article focuses on designing an arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA) with stacked bidirectional long short-term memory (SBLSTM) model for CCP. The proposed AOA-SBLSTM model intends to proficiently forecast the occurrence of CC in the telecommunication industry. Initially, the AOA-SBLSTM model per-forms pre-processing to transform the original data into a useful format. Besides, the SBLSTM model is employed to categorize data into churners and non-chur-ners. To improve the CCP outcomes of the SBLSTM model, an optimal hyper-parameter tuning process using AOA is developed.

How to detect mental fatigue has always been a hot spot for researchers to explore. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is considered one of the most accurate and objective indicators. This article investigated the development of classification algorithms applied in EEG-based fatigue detection in recent years. According to the different source of the data, we can divide these classification algorithms into two categories, intra-subject (within the same sub-ject) and cross-subject (across different subjects). In most studies, traditional machine learning algorithms with artificial feature extraction methods were commonly used for fatigue detection as intra-subject algorithms. Besides, deep learning algorithms have been applied to fatigue detection and could achieve effective result based on large-scale dataset. However, it is difficult to perform long-term calibration training on the subjects in practical applications. With the lack of large samples, transfer learning algorithms as a cross-subject algorithm could promote the practical application of fatigue detection methods. We found that the research based on deep learning and transfer learning has gradually increased in recent years.

To save energy and money, a new automated system must be developed that can detect anomalies at an early stage. This paper presents a case study of a machine learning (ML)-based computational technique for automatic fault detection in a cascade pumping system based on variable frequency drive (VFD). Since the intensity of the vibrational effect depends on which axis has the most significant effect, a three-axis accelerometer is used to measure it in the pumping system. The emphasis is on determining the vibration effect on different axes. For experiment, various ML algorithms are investigated on collected vibratory data through Matlab software in x, y, z axes and performances of the algorithms are compared based on accuracy rate, prediction speed and training time.

These optimized algorithms include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN and CNN-GWO), Support Vector Machine (SVM and SVM-GWO), and Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH and GMDH-GWO). Results obtained using these algorithms can be compared with the well-known Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) empirical model and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ML tree-based models.

Fourteen SWE geo-environmental factors are classified in topographical, hydro-climatic, land cover, and geological groups.

However, tree ensembles have the limitation that the internal decision mechanisms of complex models are difficult to understand. Therefore, we present a post-hoc interpretation approach for classification tree ensembles. The proposed method, RuleCOSI+, extracts simple rules from tree ensembles by greedily combining and simplifying their base trees. Compared with its previous version, RuleCOSI, this new version can be applied to both bagging (e.g., random forest, RF) and boosting ensembles (e.g., gradient boosting machines, GBM) and run much faster for ensembles with hundreds of trees. To assess the performance and applicability of the method, empirical experiments were conducted using two bagging algorithms and four gradient boosting algorithms over 33 datasets. RuleCOSI+ could generate the best classification rulesets in terms of F-measure together with RuleFit for RF and GBM models of the datasets among five ensemble simplification algorithms, but the rulesets of RuleCOSI+ had, on average, less than half the size of those of RuleFit. Moreover, RuleCOSI+ had the best antecedent uniqueness rate (“UNIQ”) among the five algorithms, and had also ranked high in the number of rules (“NRULES”) and the rule reduction rate (“REDU”). In addition, the proposed method could reduce generalization errors in the simplified rulesets to obtain, on average, slightly better classification errors than original models of two bagging and three gradient boosting algorithms except CATBoost. © 2022",Ensemble learning; Ensemble simplification; Explainable artificial intelligence; Interpretable machine learning; Rule extraction; tree ensembles,Article,Scopus

Injecting CO2 into a coal or shale basin can extract more CH4 and enable the permanent sequestration of CO2, and this is called CO2-enhanced coal bed methane (CO2-ECBM) or CO2-enhanced shale gas recovery (CO2-ESGR), respectively. Since the injection of captured CO2 into geological formations (geological CO2 sequestration, GCS) is considered a feasible strategy for CO2 sequestration, CO2-ECBM and CO2-ESGR have received great attention for the mitigation of global warming as well as energy recovery. Coals and shales, which are porous solids mainly containing carbons with silica-based materials, can adsorb a large amount of CO2 and CH4 depending on their pore structures/geochemical properties. Therefore, to design and practice CO2-ECBM and CO2-ESGR, it is important to understand the adsorption of CO2 and CH4 on coals and shales. A large number of laboratory experiments have been conducted to estimate the adsorption capacity of CO2 and CH4 with the structural characterization of coals and shales. However, the heterogeneous properties of coals and shales make it difficult to develop a prediction model for various types of coals and shales. This study reviews the present state of the adsorption of CO2, CH4, and their mixture on coals and shales and suggests a future research direction. The experimental results of adsorption on coals and shales from the literature are introduced, and the properties of coals and shales are discussed to understand their influence on adsorption. Then, thermodynamic models of the adsorption are analyzed to elucidate the correlation between the thermodynamic parameters and structural properties of coals and shales. Applications of machine learning (ML) models, which have received significant attention recently, to the prediction of CO2/CH4 adsorption on coals and shales are also reviewed. Finally, the combination of the thermodynamic model and the ML model, known as a hybrid model, is discussed to develop a universal prediction model for CO2/CH4 adsorption on various types of coals and shales. © 2022",Adsorption; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Machine learning; Methane; Shale,Article,Scopus

To provide feasibility for energy futures prediction, a multiscale model that integrates the decomposition-ensemble approach and the subcomponents clustering method is proposed, which overcomes the fluctuation position of the energy futures price. The subcomponents clustering method is used to obtain a number of subseries with different frequencies after decomposing the energy futures price series into several subcomponents.

To this end, we propose an individual-independent workload estimator, a cascade ensemble of multilayer autoencoders to tackle the individual difference within the EEG features. It could assess the workload levels of an unseen subject by adapting the EEG data recorded from non-overlapped existing subjects.

Its shallow weights are optimized with individual-specific geometrical information of the features. Then, to find generalizable feature properties, we introduce Q-statistics to measure the independence between base learners. Finally, a regularized extreme learning machine is used as a cascade meta-classifier to fuse and filter high-level EEG abstractions and determine workload levels. We employ databases from two different experiments to validate our approach.

However, it is difficult to predict the exact trend since stock prices are nonlinear and often appear random. To improve accuracy, the focus of modelers usually lies in improving the performance of the prediction model. However, examining the data used in training the model is imperative. Most studies of stock price trend prediction use an up-down labeling that labels data at all time points. The drawback of this labeling method is that it is sensitive to small price changes, causing inefficient model training. Therefore, this study proposes an N-Period Min-Max (NPMM) labeling that labels data only at definite time points to help overcome small price change sensitivity. The proposed model also develops a trading system using XGBoost to automate trading and verify the proposed labeling method. The proposed trading system is evaluated through an empirical analysis of 92 companies listed on the NASDAQ.

For example, an evaluation could involve training a new machine learning model. An approximation (also known as meta-model or a surrogate) of the true function can be used in such applications to alleviate the computation cost. In this paper, we propose a two-stage surrogate-assisted evolutionary approach to address the computational issues arising from using Genetic Algorithm (GA) for feature selection in a wrapper setting for large datasets. We define “Approximation Usefulness” to capture the necessary conditions to ensure correctness of the EA computations when an approximation is used. Based on this definition, we propose a procedure to construct a lightweight qualitative meta-model by the active selection of data instances. We then use a meta-model to carry out the feature selection task. We apply this procedure to the GA-based algorithm CHC (Cross generational elitist selection, Heterogeneous recombination and Cataclysmic mutation) to create a Qualitative approXimations variant, CHCQX. We show that CHCQX converges faster to feature subset solutions of significantly higher accuracy (as compared to CHC), particularly for large datasets with over 100K instances. We also demonstrate the applicability of the thinking behind our approach more broadly to Swarm Intelligence (SI), another branch of the Evolutionary Computation (EC) paradigm with results of PSOQX, a qualitative approximation adaptation of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method.

At present, machine learning approaches have been studied for computer-aided diagnosis of brain diseases, among which cascaded multi-column classifier is one of the most effective methods. However, influence of feature representation and sample distribution limits the improvement of the classification robustness and accuracy. In this work, we proposed optimiazed cascaded classifiers via enhanced feature representation and sample distribution for improving model robusteness in computer-aided diagnosis of brain disease. Specifically, we firstly extract brain connectivity features from structural and functional magnetic resonance images. The extracted features are enhanced using empirical kernel mapping to make them have better distribution in feature space. Then the enhanced features are sent into the bottommost classifier, and the predicted labels together with the enhanced features are put into the upper layer classifier to form a cascaded classification framework. During the training process, self-paced learning is used to improve model robustness by adjusting sample distribution. The experimental results on ASD and PD datasets show that the proposed method has an outstanding classification performance compared with existing methods. It suggests that enhanced feature expression and sample distrubution can help improve the model robustness and classification performance, which is meaningful for diagnosis of brain diseases. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Cascaded classifiers; Computer-aided diagnosis; Empirical kernel mapping; MRI; Self-paced learning,Article,Scopus

In particular, the use of wavelet packet node energy (WPNE) as damage sensitive features has attracted much research interest in more recent years. WPNE features tend to contain detailed information which can be highly sensitive to local damage or other forms of structural changes. However, most of the existing studies in the literature on using wavelet energy based features have been numerical and involved idealised assumptions such as perfect and identical excitations among different tests. This paper presents an experimental investigation into the viability of WPNE based techniques for detection and localisation of the structural changes in a real measurement environment. Vibration signals are acquired firstly from the test structures with different alterations to the structural states, realized mainly through the use of additional masses, and WPNE features are extracted. These features and the corresponding structural states form a dataset, from which supervised machine learning with neural network is carried out. The trained neural network is subsequently tested for its prediction capability. The experimental structures include a free-ended steel I beam, a flat beam with fixed ends and MX3D Bridge, the world’s first 3D-printed metal bridge. Different forms of excitation are involved for different test structures, including hammer impact and controlled heel drops and impacts from pedestrian footfall. Results indicate that the WPNE based neural network approach is capable of detecting and localising the structural changes in all tested structures. The accuracy is generally higher in a better controlled excitation situation, where structural changes at a level equivalent to incipient damage is detectable. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Damage identification; Machine learning; Vibration testing; Wavelet packet transform (WPT); WPT energy features,Conference Paper,Scopus

The datasets used in the experiments generally consist of benign and malicious samples; hence, binary classification is used in the machine learning models. In the binary classification task, the size of a benign sample affects the classification accuracy of malicious samples, that is, it can either improve or degrade detection accuracy. In this study, we propose a novel metric for evaluating accuracy degradation by increasing benign sample size. We mainly used the FFRI dataset, which consists of 11,243 malware samples and 250,000 benign samples, and evaluated the classification accuracy with extracted strings from the malware. In addition, we obtained other malware samples that we used as supplementary to the main dataset. We increased the number of benign samples for testing by tenfold, while maintaining the malicious sample and benign training sample sizes, which resulted in a decrease of 0.293 in the F1 score. Furthermore, we confirmed that using a sufficiently sized benign training sample set mitigates accuracy degradation. Our metric can be beneficial for evaluating the benign sample size needed in binary classification and comparing accuracy. © 2022 The Author(s)",Benign sample; Binary classification; Machine learning; Malware; Random forest; Support vector machine; XGBoost,Article,Scopus

Traditional methods for inspection and monitoring of bridges are labor-intensive and time consuming and cannot feasibly be applied to monitor all of the bridges on a large transport network. This paper proposes an approach which utilizes vibration measurements from a vehicle driving across a bridge, to monitor changes in its condition over time. In-vehicle vibrations have successfully been used in the past to identify the dynamic properties of the bridge; however, the vehicle speed and the pavement conditions have a big influence on the measured response and can often mask any changes which might occur due to damage in the bridge. This paper demonstrates an approach which combines these in-vehicle vibration measurements with an Artificial Neural Network to identify bridge damage for varying vehicle speeds. The algorithm is shown to be successful in identifying cracking in the deck and changes in the boundary conditions due to seized bearings. The impact of pre-existing damage on the ability of the algorithm to detect further deterioration in bridge condition is also examined. The results show that the sensitivity to further increases in the existing damage is slightly reduced, however the detection of other types of damage is not negatively impacted. The results of the simulations performed in this paper provide a good indication that the application of machine learning to drive-by bridge monitoring represents a promising step towards making large-scale monitoring of bridges feasible. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Artificial neural network; Bridge; Damage detection; Machine learning; Structural health monitoring,Conference Paper,Scopus

However, recent research has shown that specially crafted perturbations, called adversarial examples, are capable of significantly reducing the performance of these intrusion detection systems. The objective of this paper is to design an efficient transfer learning-based adversarial detector and then to assess the effectiveness of using multiple strategically placed adversarial detectors compared to a single adversarial detector for intrusion detection systems. In our experiments, we implement existing state-of-the-art models for intrusion detection. We then attack those models with a set of chosen evasion attacks. In an attempt to detect those adversarial attacks, we design and implement multiple transfer learning-based adversarial detectors, each receiving a subset of the information passed through the IDS. By combining their respective decisions, we illustrate that combining multiple detectors can further improve the detectability of adversarial traffic compared to a single detector in the case of a parallel IDS design. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Adversarial detection; Data fusion; Evasion attacks; Intrusion detection system; Machine learning; Transfer learning,Article,Scopus

A typical example is a bridge deck comprising of concrete slab and steel beam girders, with shear connectors linking the concrete slab and the steel beams to form the composite effect. The behaviour of a composite structure is dependent not only on the condition of the main constituent components, namely concrete slab and the steel beams, but also on the effectiveness of the shear connectors. In fact, the influences of damage to the main components (herein called flexural damage) and damage to the shear connectors on the overall structural performance are distinctively different. Therefore it is important that damages in a composite structure be distinguished between these two types of parameters. However, not much attention has been paid in differentiating the flexural and shear connector damages in the existing damage identification literature. In this paper we will provide an overall discussion on the distinctive effects of flexural and shear-connector damages to the rigidity and its distribution in a composite beam. A vibration based approach is then presented for the identification of the mixed presence of flexural and shear-link damage parameters by means of supervised machine learning. The wavelet packet node energy (WPNE), which has been shown to be sensitive to structural changes in previous studies, is chosen as input features. Appropriate selection of the wavelet packet transformation levels in the case using a single measurement sensor, as well as using multiple sensors, are discussed. Results demonstrate that with WPNE features combined with supervised machine learning, it is possible to differentiate and identify flexural and shear-connector damages, and hence the actual structural condition, of a composite beam. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Composite beams; Damage assessment; Flexural damage; Machine learning; Shear-link damage; Wavelet packet transform,Conference Paper,Scopus

Due to its simplicity, K-Means is often used in machine learning unsupervised clustering applications. However, the execution performance of K-Means can easily become a bottleneck when dealing with very large datasets, paired with a great number of clusters, as those encountered in many big data ecosystems. Therefore, many efforts are reported in the literature devoted to a parallelization of K-Means, both on shared-nothing and shared-memory architectures. This paper proposes a novel approach to parallel K-Means on multi/many-core machines, which is based on the Theatre actor system developed in Java. The realization is based on message passing for synchronization among actors (workers) but also offers the possibility of sharing data, in a controlled and safe way, among the actors of the same computing node (theatre).

It is of great significance to obtain MW from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Due to the characteristics of random nonstationarity, EEG signals in different time sessions are quite different. This results in the poor generalization ability and low accuracy of the model when task generated EEG signals are used to identify MW. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a MW classification method based on EEG cross-session subspace alignment. The labeled EEG signals with known MW and the unlabeled EEG signals to be identified are obtained. By learning a linear mapping, the source subspace base vector is aligned with the target subspace base vector, which solves the problem of different marginal distribution of EEG signals in the same space in different sessions. Through experiments, compared with the existing methods, this method can obtain better classification results. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Cross-session; EEG; Mental workload; SVM,Conference Paper,Scopus

Recently, massive amount of text has been generated over Internet daily which makes the pattern recognition and decision making process difficult. Since OM find useful in business sectors to improve the quality of the product as well as services, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models can be considered into account. Besides, the hyperparameters involved in the DL models necessitate proper adjustment process to boost the classification process. Therefore, in this paper, a new Artificial Fish Swarm Optimization with Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (AFSO-BLSTM) model has been developed for OM process. The major intention of the AFSO-BLSTM model is to effectively mine the opinions present in the textual data. In addition, the AFSO-BLSTM model undergoes pre-processing and TF-IFD based feature extraction process. Besides, BLSTM model is employed for the effectual detection and classification of opinions. Finally, the AFSO algorithm is utilized for effective hyperparameter adjustment process of the BLSTM model, shows the novelty of the work. A complete simulation study of the AFSO-BLSTM model is validated using benchmark dataset and the obtained experimental values revealed the high potential of the AFSO-BLSTM model on mining opinions. © 2023 CRL Publishing.

The pandemic’s exponential expansion of infected COVID-19 patients has challenged the medical field’s resources, which are already few. Even established nations would not be in a perfect position to manage this epidemic correctly, leaving emerging countries and countries that have not yet begun to grow to address the problem. These problems can be solved by using machine learning models in a realistic way, such as by using computer-aided images during medical examinations. These models help predict the effects of the disease outbreak and help detect the effects in the coming days. In this paper, Multi-Features Decease Analysis (MFDA) is used with different ensemble classifiers to diagnose the disease’s impact with the help of Computed Tomography (CT) scan images. There are various features associated with chest CT images, which help know the possibility of an individual being affected and how COVID-19 will affect the persons suffering from pneumonia. The current study attempts to increase the precision of the diagnosis model by evaluating various feature sets and choosing the best combination for better results.

Alternatively, they can be learned from feature and performance data produced during compilation. However, data-driven compiler optimizations based on machine learning models require large sets of quality data for training in order to match or even outperform existing human-crafted heuristics. In static compilation setups, related work has addressed this problem with iterative compilation. However, a dynamic compiler may produce different data depending on dynamically-chosen compilation strategies, which aggravates the generation of comparable data. We propose compilation forking, a technique for generating consistent feature and performance data from arbitrary, dynamically-compiled programs. Different versions of program parts with the same profiling and compilation history are executed within single program runs to minimize noise stemming from dynamic compilation and the runtime environment. Our approach facilitates large-scale performance evaluations of compiler optimization decisions. Addition-ally, compilation forking supports creating domain-specific compilation strategies based on machine learning by providing the data for model training. We implemented compilation forking in the GraalVM compiler in a programming-language-agnostic way. To assess the quality of the generated data, we trained several machine learning models to replace compiler heuristics for loop-related optimizations. The trained models perform equally well to the highly-tuned compiler heuristics when comparing the geometric means of benchmark suite performances. Larger impacts on few single benchmarks range from speedups of 20% to slowdowns of 17%. The presented approach can be implemented in any dynamic compiler. We believe that it can help to analyze compilation decisions and leverage the use of machine learning into dynamic compilation. © R. Mosaner, D. Leopoldseder, W. Kisling, L. Stadler, H.

This was achieved with optimized sensing units made with layer-by-layer films and by treating the capacitance data with machine learning algorithms employing decision trees models. These films were made with chitosan, chondroitin sulfate, sericin and gold nanoparticles /sericin, whose molecular-level interaction with S.aureus depended on the architecture according to PM-IRRAS measurements. The limit of detection in blank milk varied from 3.41 to 2.01 CFU/mL depending on the sensing unit. This sensitivity was complemented with the selectivity provided by combining the electrical responses of the four sensing units. Indeed, with machine learning it was possible to determine multidimensional calibration spaces (MCS) that could generate rules to explain how the milk samples could be discriminated. With a 7-dimension MCS, distinct S.aureus concentrations could be distinguished from possible interferents with a 100 % accuracy. In crude milk samples, 94 % accuracy was obtained with a 6-dimension MCS in multiclass classification for milk from different udders of a mastitis infected cow, including samples diluted 50-fold, in addition to milk from an infected cow treated with Bronopol and from a healthy cow. It is significant that in a ternary classification with these crude milk samples, a 2-dimension MCS could distinguish between milk from an infected cow, treated with Bronopol and from a healthy cow with 100 % accuracy. The combination of electronic tongues and machine learning – as in this proof-of-concept study - is promising for diagnosis of mastitis at a low cost. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Electronic tongue; Impedance spectroscopy; Machine learning; Mastitis; Multidimensional calibration space; S.aureus; Sensors,Article,Scopus

It also degrades the performance of machine listening applications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of binaural dereverberation of a single speech source, using the differences in the interaural cues of the direct path signal and the reverberations. Two beamformers, spaced at an interaural distance, are used to extract the reverberations from the reverberant speech. The interaural cues generated by these reverberations and those generated by the direct path signal act as a two-class dataset, used for the training of U-Net (a deep convolutional neural network). After its training, the beamformers are removed and the trained U-Net along with the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) algorithm is used to discriminate between the direct path cues from the reverberation cues, when the system is exposed to the interaural spectrogram of the reverberant speech signal. Our proposed model has outperformed the classical signal processing dereverberation model ‘weighted prediction error’ in terms of cepstral distance (CEP), frequency weighted segmental signal to noise ratio (fwsegSNR) and signal-to-reverberation modulation energy ratio (SRMR) by 1.4 points, 8 dB and 0.6 dB. It has achieved better performance than the deep learning based dereverberation model by gaining 1.3 points improvement in CEP with comparable fwsegSNR, using training dataset which is almost 8 times smaller than required for that model. The proposed model also sustained its performance under relatively similar unseen acoustic conditions and at positions in the vicinity of its training position. © 2022",Beamforming; Deep learning; Direct wave; Interaural cues; Reverberations,Article,Scopus

Consequently, the variation in the signal strength of LoRaWAN parking systems transmits information about parking space occupancy, allowing the implementation of a passive side-channel attack at large distances.

Time-varying ECG data are represented as three-dimensional vectorcardiogram (VCG) and the underlying cardiac dynamics. Nonlinear dynamics measures, including entropy variability measures, complexity measures and chaotic measures, are calculated and fed into different machine learning methods for the classification task. The extracted nonlinear dynamics measures reflect in-depth cardiac dynamics characteristic, which is shown to be more sensitive to subtle ECG modifications. Therefore, it is expected to provide an early detection tool for latent ECG modifications before obvious diagnostic changes are observed.

Thus, early detection is crucial to avoid serious complications. Existing methods require specialized equipment and technical expertise, and accurate machine learning diagnosis of AF remains a dream. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end AF recognition method with dual-path recurrent neural network (DPRNN) from single-lead ECG. The model takes the whole ECG as input, and DPRNN splits the ECG into shorter segments and models the sequence between intra- and inter-segment iteratively. A mix-up operation is used for data augmentation, which overcomes the issue of limited data. We evaluated our method on the dataset from PhysioNet Challenge 2017. Experimental results shows that the proposed method can both effectively recognize AF with ECG signal without any human expertise, and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.

While seminal work focused on establishing class overlap as a complicating factor for classification tasks in imbalanced domains, ongoing research mostly concerns the study of their synergy over real-word applications. However, given the lack of a well-formulated definition and measurement of class overlap in real-world domains, especially in the presence of class imbalance, the research community has not yet reached a consensus on the characterisation of both problems. This naturally complicates the evaluation of existing approaches to address these issues simultaneously and prevents future research from moving towards the devise of specialised solutions. In this work, we advocate for a unified view of the problem of class overlap in imbalanced domains. Acknowledging class overlap as the overarching problem – since it has proven to be more harmful for classification tasks than class imbalance – we start by discussing the key concepts associated to its definition, identification, and measurement in real-world domains, while advocating for a characterisation of the problem that attends to multiple sources of complexity. We then provide an overview of existing data complexity measures and establish the link to what specific types of class overlap problems these measures cover, proposing a novel taxonomy of class overlap complexity measures. Additionally, we characterise the relationship between measures, the insights they provide, and discuss to what extent they account for class imbalance. Finally, we systematise the current body of knowledge on the topic across several branches of Machine Learning (Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing, Algorithm Design, and Meta-learning), identifying existing limitations and discussing possible lines for future research. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Class imbalance; Class overlap; Complexity measures; Data complexity; Data intrinsic characteristics; Imbalanced data,Short Survey,Scopus

This process converts the original univariate time series into a multi variate time series. The “day-of-the-week” dummy variable is converted into seven variables using one-hot encoding and augmented to the multivariate or univariate time series depending on whether chaos was present or absent. For forecasting the future cash withdrawals, we employed (i) statistical technique namely autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), (ii) machine learning techniques such as random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), group method of data handling (GMDH), and general regression neural network (GRNN), and (iii) DL techniques such as long short term memory (LSTM) neural network, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN).

The results show that, affected by the types of coke ovens and regions, China’s current coking enterprises have implemented a total of 21 emission standards, with marked differences. After adding QRPES, it was found that the root mean squared error (RMSE) of SVR and RFR decreased from 0.055 kt/a and 0.059 kt/a to 0.045 kt/a and 0.039 kt/a, and the R2 increased from 0.890 and 0.881 to 0.926 and 0.945, respectively. This shows that the QRPES can greatly improve the prediction accuracy, and the SO2 emissions of each enterprise are highly correlated with the strictness of standards. The predicted result shows that 45% of SO2 emissions from Chinese coking enterprises are concentrated in Shanxi, Shaanxi and Hebei provinces in central China.

Cracks in sheet material, which are frequently seen in mass production, cause vehicle scraps, so the degree of impact and cost are high. Crack tests were performed on 490 different sheets on sheet material in the 0.6-3 mm thickness range, and a crack image dataset was created for sheet material. In addition, 121 non-cracked “accepted-approved” parts were included in the dataset. Due to its superior feature extraction capability, convolutional neural network (CNN) has been widely researched, applied and outperformed other traditional machine learning methods in the field of intelligent fault diagnosis. After that, the cracked and non-cracked part data in the sheet material was divided into training and test data, and the accuracy values. Here, accuracy and verification accuracy rates as 98.5% and 90% were achieved respectively. Accuracy values with VGGNet architecture are 98.75% and 90%. This gives information about the reliability of both the picture data of the faults and the model presented.

Actinic keratosis (AK) is the pathognomonic lesion of CFC. Therefore, the reliable and non-invasive AK burden assessment is essential to assist clinicians in delivering patient-tailored therapeutic interventions and support the objective evaluation of emerging therapeutic modalities. Herein, we introduce a system for automated AK detection in CFC areas. For the differentiation of AK from healthy skin areas and co-localized benign growths (Seborrheic Keratosis/Lentigo Solaris; SK/LS), cross-polarized digital photographs of afflicted skin surfaces were taken, and a convolutional neural network (AKCNN) whose convolution part was optimally transferred from a pre-trained VGG16 was implemented. For the detection of multifocal AK in wide skin regions, superpixels were employed to generate region patches for the subsequent evaluation. AKCNN was implemented and evaluated in 19739, 43067, and 12,205 image patches of AK, SK/LS, and healthy skin, respectively, originating from 46 patients. AKCNN performance was assessed in two ways: (a) patch classification using the macro averaged F1 score and (b) AK burden evaluation in broad skin areas using an adapted region-based F1 (aF1) score. Using raw clinical images, AKCNN exhibited a macro F1 of 0.78 at patch level and a region-based aF1 of 0.81, with good tolerance against image scaling. The proposed system efficiently uses cross-polarized clinical photography to assess the AK burden within the CFC. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Actinic; Classification; CNN; Field cancerization; Keratosis; Skin disease; Transfer learning,Article,Scopus

Several optimization methods are usually used to optimize the number of user-chosen for cooperation and the threshold selection. However, these methods do not take into account the effect of sample size and its effect on improving CoR performance. In general, a large sample size results in more reliable detection, but takes longer sensing time and increases complexity. Thus, the locally sensed sample size is an optimization problem. Therefore, optimizing the local sample size for each cognitive user helps to improve CoR performance. In this study, two new methods are proposed to find the optimum sample size to achieve objective-based improved (single/double) threshold energy detection, these methods are the optimum sample size N* and neural networks (NN) optimization.

The development of graph-based semi-supervised learning models has attracted much attention from machine learning researchers. In this paper, we present a novel approach for graph-based semi-supervised learning. We provide an effective method for simultaneous label recovery and linear transformation estimation. The targeted linear transformation is to obtain a discriminant subspace. The most important factor in this work to improve the semi-supervised learning is to exploit the data structure and soft labels of the available unlabeled samples. In the iterative optimization scheme used, the prior estimation of the labels increases the monitoring information in an indirect way through an introduced label-graph, avoiding the use of confidence-based hard decisions as used in self-supervised methods. It also enforces label smoothing and projected data smoothing through the use of hybrid graphs. For each smoothing type, the hybrid graph is an adaptive fusion of the two graphs encoding the similarity of the data information and the similarity of the label information. The proposed method leads to an improved discriminant linear transformation. Several experimental results on real image datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. This work also shows superior performance compared to semi-supervised methods that use simultaneous embedding and inference of labels. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Auto-weighted graph fusion; Discriminant embedding; Image categorization; Semi-supervised learning; Soft labels; Structured data,Article,Scopus

The traditional method is based on rule computation and self-similarity idea preliminarily performing the DP classification. However, DP segmentation is an uncertain spatial cognitive problem affected by enormous factors. To settle such a multi-conditions decision question, this study takes the segmentation of parallel drainage pattern (SPDP) as an example presenting a deep learning method, namely the graph convolution neural network (GCNN) based on Graph SAmple and aggreGatE (GraphSAGE). First, a directed graph and dual graph were used to construct a dual drainage graph recording spatial-cognition features of drainage. Second, nine drainage features were built to define the graph description from three perspectives: topological connectivity, meandering equilibrium, and directional unity. Finally, the GraphSAGE model was designed for SPDP and trained by typical samples to finish the segmentation works. The experiment examined the optimal feature combination and hyperparameter sensitivity, which can provide sufficient information for SPDP supported by GraphSAGE. Besides, our model outperformed other machine learning methods and GCNNs driven by a fixed quantity sampling mechanism and hydrological knowledge.

Data from the camera is sent to energy efficient sink to extract key-information out of it. VWSN applications range from health care monitoring to military surveillance. In a network with VWSN, there are multiple challenges to move high volume data from a source location to a target and the key challenges include energy, memory and I/O resources. In this case, Mobile Sinks (MS) can be employed for data collection which not only collects information from particular chosen nodes called Cluster Head (CH), it also collects data from nearby nodes as well. The innovation of our work is to intelligently decide on a particular node as CH whose selection criteria would directly have an impact on QoS parameters of the system. However, making an appropriate choice during CH selection is a daunting task as the dynamic and mobile nature of MSs has to be taken into account. We propose Genetic Machine Learning based Fuzzy system for clustering which has the potential to simulate human cognitive behavior to observe, learn and understand things from manual perspective. Proposed architecture is designed based on Mamdani’s fuzzy model. Following parameters are derived based on the model residual energy, node centrality, distance between the sink and current position, node centrality, node density, node history, and mobility of sink as input variables for decision making in CH selection. The inputs received have a direct impact on the Fuzzy logic rules mechanism which in turn affects the accuracy of VWSN. The proposed work creates a mechanism to learn the fuzzy rules using Genetic Algorithm (GA) and to optimize the fuzzy rules base in order to eliminate irrelevant and repetitive rules. Genetic algorithm-based machine learning optimizes the interpretability aspect of fuzzy system. Simulation results are obtained using MATLAB. The result shows that the classification accuracy increase along with minimizing fuzzy rules count and thus it can be inferred that the suggested methodology has a better protracted lifetime in contrast with Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) and LEACH-Expected Residual Energy (LEACH-ERE). © 2023 CRL Publishing.

Early prognosis of ALL is indispensable for the effectual remediation of this disease. Initial screening of ALL is conducted through manual examination of stained blood smear microscopic images, a process which is time-consuming and prone to errors. Therefore, many deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been established to automatically diagnose ALL. This paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning system for ALL diagnosis in blood smear images. The introduced system integrates the proficiency of autoencoder networks in feature representational learning in latent space with the superior feature extraction capability of standard pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify the existence of ALL in blood smears. An augmented set of deep image features are formed from the features extracted by GoogleNet and Inception-v3 CNNs from a hybrid dataset of microscopic blood smear images. A sparse autoencoder network is designed to create an abstract set of significant latent features from the enlarged image feature set. The latent features are used to perform image classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The obtained results show that the latent features improve the classification performance of the proposed ALL diagnosis system over the original image features. Moreover, the classification performance of the system with various sizes of the latent feature set is evaluated.

The safety towards data transfer seems to be a threat where Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is measured as an essential element to fulfill security. Recently, Machine Learning (ML) approaches have been used for the construction of intellectual IDS. Most IDS are based on ML techniques either as unsupervised or supervised. In supervised learning, NIDS is based on labeled data where it reduces the efficiency of the reduced model to identify attack patterns. Similarly, the unsupervised model fails to provide a satisfactory outcome. Hence, to boost the functionality of unsupervised learning, an effectual auto-encoder is applied for feature selection to select good features. Finally, the Naïve Bayes classifier is used for classification purposes. This approach exposes the finest generalization ability to train the data. The unlabelled data is also used for adoption towards data analysis. Here, redundant and noisy samples over the dataset are eliminated.

Shipments of essential and life-saving products, ranging from pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and healthcare, to manufacturing, have been significantly impacted or delayed, making the global SCs vulnerable. A better understanding of the shipment risks can substantially reduce that nervousness. Thenceforth, this paper proposes a few Deep Learning (DL) approaches to mitigate shipment risks by predicting ”if a shipment can be exported from one source to another”, despite the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed DL methodologies have four main stages: data capturing, de-noising or pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. The feature extraction stage depends on two main variants of DL models. The first variant involves three recurrent neural networks (RNN) structures (i.e., long short-term memory (LSTM), Bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU)), and the second variant is the temporal convolutional network (TCN). In terms of the classification stage, six different classifiers are applied to test the entire methodology. These classifiers are SoftMax, random trees (RT), random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM). The performance of the proposed DL models is evaluated based on an online dataset (taken as a case study). The numerical results show that one of the proposed models (i.e., TCN) is about 100% accurate in predicting the risk of shipment to a particular destination under COVID-19 restrictions. Unarguably, the aftermath of this work will help the decision-makers to predict supply chain risks proactively to increase the resiliency of the SCs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Classifiers; Convolutional network; COVID-19; Deep learning; Supply chain risk; Temporal convolutional network,Article,Scopus

Concomitant with recent advancements in computer performance and intelligent algorithms, the efficacy of pulmonary nodule computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has been continuously improving, and various algorithms have been proposed using different datasets. This study systematically analyzed and compared the performance of machine learning algorithms using the same dataset in the diagnosis of pulmonary nodules through a literature review. Methods: The widely used LIDC-IDRI dataset and its subset LUNA16 were used as data objects. The SpringerLink, Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed scientific databases were searched, and seventy-five papers were analyzed. Results: Deep-learning-based CAD was found to be superior to conventional machine-learning-based CAD in terms of the number of published studies and algorithm performance. The best performances were as follows: feedforward neural network (FNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) for detecting pulmonary nodules; region-based CNN (R-CNN) for the segmentation of pulmonary nodules; residual neural network (ResNet) for the classification of nodules and non-nodules; and deep neural network (DNN) for the classification of benign and malignancy. Conclusion: To further extend the application of CAD in clinical practice, the appropriate algorithm type should be used based on the characteristics of the task. The CAD process should be divided into logical stages and the optimal algorithm for each stage should be used to increase the reliability of the process.

Data sharing among vehicles can be used to optimize fatigue detection models and ensure driving safety. However, data privacy issues hinder the sharing process. Besides, due to the limitation of communication and computing resources, it is difficult to carry out training and data transmission on vehicles. To tackle these challenges, we propose FedSup, a communication-efficient federated learning method for fatigue driving behaviors supervision. Inspired by the resources allocation mechanism in edge intelligence, FedSup dynamically optimizes the sharing model with tailored client–edge–cloud architecture and reduces communication overhead by a Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) data selection strategy. To improve the sharing model optimize efficiency, we further propose an asynchronous parameters aggregation algorithm to automatically adjust the mixing weight of each edge model parameter. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the FedSup method is suitable for IoV scenarios and outperforms related federated learning methods in terms of communication overhead and model accuracy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks; Fatigue detection; Federated learning; Internet of Vehicles; Machine learning; Uncertainty analysis,Article,Scopus

Currently, a neurologist determines the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease by taking into account several factors. An automated decision-making system would enhance patient care and improve the outcomes for the patient. Biomarkers, such as electroencephalograms (EEGs), can aid in the diagnosis process as they have proven useful in detecting abnormalities in the brain. This study presents a novel algorithm for the automated diagnosis of Parkinson's disease from EEG signals using a flexible analytic wavelet transform (FAWT). First, these acquired EEG signals are preprocessed before decomposition into five frequency sub-bands based on the FAWT method. Several entropy parameters are computed from the decomposed sub-bands and ranked based on their significance level in detecting PD through analysis of variance (ANOVA). Various classifiers are used to identify appropriate feature sets, including support vector machines (SVM), logistics, random forests (RF), radial basis functions (RBF), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN). The proposed approach is evaluated using data collected from two centers in Malaysia (Dataset-I) and the United States (Dataset-II). In dataset-I, the KNN classifier produces accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and area under the curve of 99%, 99.45%, 99.12%, and 0.991, respectively, while in dataset-II, these values are 95.85%, 95.88%, 96.14%, and 0.959.

In this approach, the electrochemical properties of biochar are correlated with properties called descriptors. In this work, several simple and efficient machine learning (ML) models were used to predict the electrical capacity of biochar through activation conditions, biochar properties, and testing conditions. The established ML model predicted the capacitance of biochar with 9 descriptors that are readily available values during the preparation of biochar. The prediction performance of four regression methods (Decision Tree (DT), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest (RF)) were evaluated with a test set/training set ratio of 8 to 2. Among the four regression methods, XGBoost had the best prediction effect on the electrochemical performance of biochar with a low mean root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) close to 1. In addition, the analysis of the importance of the features under each model combined with the existing research verifies the rationality of the model.

We aimed to develop an automated lightweight EEG signal-based sentence classification model using a novel dynamic-sized binary pattern (DSBP) textural feature extractor and iterative multi-classifiers based majority voting (IMCMV) algorithm for iterative voting of results calculated using different classifiers for multi-channel EEG signal inputs. A new Turkish sentence EEG(TSEEG) was prospectively acquired. It comprised of 15-second 14-channel EEG signals recorded when 40 volunteers (for each dataset, we collected EEG signals from 20 participants) were either shown or read corresponding to demonstration or listening modes, respectively. Hence, 20 standardized commonly used sentences were obtained in their native Turkish language. The developed sentence classification model extracted 5,400 multilevel deep features from each channel EEG signal segment using the novel DSBP, statistical features, and multilevel discrete wavelet transform (MDWT). 512 features were then chosen using the neighborhood component analysis selection function. k-nearest neighbor and support vector machine classifiers were used to calculate two prediction vectors from the selected features using tenfold cross-validation, i.e., 28 vectors were generated for each 14-channel EEG recording. Finally, the best general voted results were determined for increasing numbers of iteratively calculated prediction vectors using the novel IMCMV algorithm. Channel-wise and voted results were found to be excellent for sentence classification for the TSEEG dataset in both demonstration and listening modes. The DSBP-IMCMV-based model attained the best general classification rates of 98.81% and 98.19% in the demonstration and listening modes, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Dynamic sized binary pattern; EEG sentence classification; Iterative multi-classifiers based majority voting; Machine learning; Neighborhood component analysis,Article,Scopus

Complementary to the explicit usage of Semantic Web resources, embedding methods made them applicable to machine learning tasks. Subsequently, embedding models for numerous tasks and structures have been developed, and embedding spaces for various resources have been published. The ecosystem of embedding spaces is distributed but not interoperable: Entity embeddings are not readily comparable across different spaces. To parallel the Web of Data with a Web of Embeddings, we must thus integrate available embedding spaces into a uniform space. Current integration approaches are limited to two spaces and presume that both of them were embedded with the same method — both assumptions are unlikely to hold in the context of a Web of Embeddings. In this paper, we present FedCoder— an approach that integrates multiple embedding spaces via a latent space. We assert that linked entities have a similar representation in the latent space so that entities become comparable across embedding spaces. FedCoder employs an autoencoder to learn this latent space from linked as well as non-linked entities. Our experiments show that FedCoder substantially outperforms state-of-the-art approaches when faced with different embedding models, that it scales better than previous methods in the number of embedding spaces, and that it improves with more graphs being integrated whilst performing comparably with current approaches that assumed joint learning of the embeddings and were, usually, limited to two sources.

Due to the environmental factors that PV systems function in, they can be prone to multiple types of fault conditions such as string-to-string (SS), string-to-ground (SG), and open-circuit faults (OC). If left undetected, these faults can lead to power loss and eventually system failures. To help mitigate such outcomes, this paper presents an approach to detect, classify, and locate SS, SG, and OC faults using multi-output deep learning (DL) algorithms: convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) networks. The proposed approach reduces the number of sensors needed per string by 50% compared to the previous approaches in the literature. It also allows for increased scalability and the development of a multi-label dataset through an uncoupled modeling scheme.

When viewing the image, they estimate the interaction force on the basis of pseudo-haptics. The interaction force of a robot is traditionally measured using a contact-type tactile sensor or a force/torque (F/T) sensor. In this work, we propose a method for estimating the interaction force between a robot and objects during grasping and picking. The method is based on images, without involving an F/T sensor or a tactile sensor. For undeformable objects, more precise force estimation was achieved by simultaneously using RGB and depth images, the robot position, and electrical current. We propose a deep neural network structure that combines DenseNet and a Transformer encoder/decoder for predicting the interaction force. We verified proposed network with generated DB which has recorded the interaction with 41 objects. Additionally, we compared the results with changing the inputs of the network. Our model could estimate the interaction force from various input modalities for both known objects and unseen objects during its training.

Transductive support vector machine (TSVM) is an important semi-supervised learning method which formulates the problem as a nonconvex combinatorial optimization problem. The infinitesimal annealing algorithm is a novel training method of TSVM which can alleviate the impact of the combinatorial and non-convex natures in TSVM and achieve a fast training of TSVM. However, it is still a challenging problem to handle large-scale data for TSVM even using the infinitesimal annealing algorithm. To mitigate this problem, in this paper, we propose an incremental learning algorithm for TSVM (ILTSVM) based on the path following technique under the framework of infinitesimal annealing. Specifically, for new samples, we call CP-Step to change the solution and partition by increasing the size of the penalty coefficient. The difference between training labeled samples and training unlabeled samples is that the variation range of the penalty coefficient of labeled samples is larger than that of unlabeled samples. If in the process of CP-Step, pseudo-labels of unlabeled samples are classified incorrectly, call DJ-Step to flip the pseudo-labels, and use incremental and decremental algorithms to make the KKT condition satisfied. We also analyze the time complexity and convergence of ILTSVM. The experimental results show that compared with other incremental or batch learning algorithms, our algorithm is the most effective and fastest method for training TSVM. © 2022",Incremental learning; Infinitesimal annealing; Non-convex optimization; Transductive support vector machine,Article,Scopus

In order to obtain a representation of the soil conditions that is as close to reality as possible, subsurface investigations such as core drillings or soundings are necessary. Based on the findings of these investigation campaigns, similar soils are grouped into layers and subsequently ground models are defined, which serve as the basis for conventional analysis or numerical investigations. In recent years, the Cone Penetration Test (CPT) has established itself as a sound alternative to costly and time-consuming core drillings. However, when using CPT, the subsoil is not visible to the engineer, making the interpretation of CPT data difficult. For the classification of soils into groups with similar properties, various soil behavior type charts based on the CPT data were published. Additionally, data science tools such as machine learning are increasingly being used to interpret CPT data. However, regardless of the interpretation method used, defining the layer boundaries and combining them into a three-dimensional model is usually done manually, thus it is still based on experience. The present work aims to provide an automatic identification of soil layers from CPT data using a combination of machine learning models. The presented approach was also tested using CPT data from a benchmark site in Austria and showed very good agreement with results of traditional (experience based) interpretation of soil investigations. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Cone penetration test; Kernel density estimation; Machine learning; Random forest,Conference Paper,Scopus

In the present work, an artificial neural network model is proposed for predicting the heat transfer and weight values of a panel radiator as outputs depending on the design parameters of convectors. In the multilayer network model developed with 78 numerically obtained data sets, 8 different design parameters were defined as input parameters and heat transfer and in the output layer panel weight values were obtained. The design parameters of the convectors, in other words, input parameters of network model were chosen as the height of convector, thickness of convector sheet, the trapezoidal height of convector, convector base length, opposing convector distance, tip width of convector, convector vertical location and distance between convectors. For the proposed neural network model, the mean squared errors obtained for the heat transfer and panel radiator weight are ?1.25E-04 and -7.54E-05 respectively. In addition, an R-value of 0.99999 has been obtained, and the average deviation value has been calculated as 0.001%. The obtained results show that, depending on the design parameters, the proposed artificial neural network model can predict the rate of heat transfer and weight of the panel radiator with high accuracy. This investigation is supposed to fill a significant gap since it is the pioneer one in open sources on machine learning modeling of panel radiators. Thus, it can possibly make a crucial contribution to the related manufacturing industry. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS",Artificial neural network (ANN); Computational fluid dynamics (CFD); Convector; Heat transfer; Panel radiator,Article,Scopus

The traditional feature extraction methods to reveal the health condition of the machine are labor-extensive. They usually depend on engineered design features, which require an expert knowledge level. Inspired by the successful results of deep-learning approaches that redefine representation learning from raw data, we propose moving-averaged features-based on Long-Short Term Memory (MaF-LSTM) networks. It is a hybrid approach that combines engineered features design with self-feature learning for the purpose of machine condition monitoring. First, features from overlapped sliding windows of the input time-series signals are extracted. Then, a moving-average filter is applied on the top of the generated features to enhance the feature's condition indicter's content. Next, a bidirectional LSTM is applied to learn the feature representation from the moving-averaged features. Two experiments, namely, bearing fault diagnosis and hydraulic accumulator fault detection, are implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed MaF-LSTM. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms all traditional condition monitoring methods in both use cases. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

By collecting 8-channels of MMG of 4 types of hand movements (wrist flexion, wrist extension, wrist ulnar flexion, and wrist radial flexion), after signal preprocessing, feature extraction and dimensionality reduction, 12 groups of non-identical distributed data were obtained. The model was trained by using deep neural network (DNN), and five commonly used machine learning algorithms were used as comparison for incremental training. Finally, the recognition rate of DNN was 88.25%, and the final recognition rates of Passive Aggressive (PA), Incremental Support Vector Machine (ISVM), Perceptron, Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BNB) and Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) were 85.94%, 84.82%, 81.01%, 73.07% and 61.20% respectively. Among them, both DNN and PA had better upward trends, and DNN had the highest final recognition rate. By comparing the confusion matrices before and after DNN incremental learning, it could be seen that DNN incremental training can significantly improve the accuracy and precision in confusion matrix. The experimental results demonstrate that the method of incremental learning can not only achieve the recognition of non-identically distributed test data, but also improve the recognition rates and the generalization performance of the model. © 2022",Deep neural network; Incremental learning; Mechanomyography; Non-identical distribution; Upper limb rehabilitation action,Article,Scopus

Nowadays, needle electromyography (nEMG) is the standard practice for electrodiagnosis of ALS. Surface electromyography (sEMG) is emerging as a more practical and less painful alternative to nEMG but still has analytical and technical challenges. The objective of this work was to study the feasibility of using a set of morphological features extracted from sEMG to support a machine learning pipeline for ALS diagnosis. We developed a novel feature set to characterize sEMG based on quantitative measurements to surface representation of Motor Unit Action Potentials. We conducted several experiments to study the relevance of the proposed feature set either individually or combined with conventional feature sets from temporal, statistical, spectral, and fractal domains. We validated the proposed machine learning pipeline on a dataset with sEMG upper limb muscle data from 17 ALS patients and 24 control subjects. The results support the utility of the proposed feature set, achieving an F1 score of (81.9 ± 5.7) for the onset classification approach and (83.6 ± 6.9) for the subject classification approach, solely relying on features extracted from the proposed feature set in the right first dorsal interosseous muscle. We concluded that introducing the proposed feature set is relevant for automated ALS diagnosis since it increased the classifier performance during our experiments. The proposed feature set might also help design more interpretable classifiers as the features give additional information related to the nature of the disease, being inspired by the clinical interpretation of sEMG. © 2022",Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Feature selection; Machine learning; Signal processing; Surface electromyography; Time series,Article,Scopus

However, it can be challenging in real-world applications, especially when there are missing labels in multi-class classification tasks. Although partial feedback can be applied to tackle the problem, it can make the learning process slow and limit the classification performance as the correct label information is missing when the instance is misclassified. To cope with the lack of the target domain knowledge in online learning, transfer learning can be applied to convey knowledge from one or multiple source domains to the target domain. To this end, we propose a partial feedback online transfer learning algorithm with multiple source domains (PFMSD) to transfer the knowledge learned from multi-source domains to the target domain and enhance the learning performance by exploring the correct label when there is an erroneous prediction. A mistake bound is derived for the proposed algorithm, and extensive experiments are conducted using several wildly-used benchmark datasets.

Thermal images of plantar feet are indicative of these conditions and can aid in understanding the overall foot health in such subjects. Methods: This study aims to classify the thermal distribution patterns in feet of diabetic subjects versus normals, patterns in diabetic subjects into those having DFS versus not having DFS and patterns in DFS subjects into those with PAD versus DPN. The classifications were based machine learning techniques using plantar foot temperature features. Results: The thermal patterns were classified with cross validation accuracies of 98.89%, 95.2% and 97.1% respectively.

This study proposed a new control scheme that simultaneously estimates continuous grip force and wrist angles using a combination of surface electromyography (sEMG) and acceleration (ACC) signals. Four popular EMG features were utilized to study the regression accuracy. Nine intact subjects were recruited. They performed six force-position varying movements which involved simultaneous activation of four DOFs (wrist flexion/extension, ulnar/radial deviation, pronation/supination, and grip). The estimation performance was evaluated by the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (cc). The highest cc value was 92.12 ± 1.51%, 96.68 ± 1.16%, and 97.18 ± 0.69% for the sEMG-only, ACC-only, and multi-modal methods, respectively. Results indicate that the multi-modal approach can significantly improve regression accuracy of concurrent grip force and wrist angles, especially in pronation/supination. Besides, the multi-modal method showed higher robustness when the available number of sensors decreased and better generalization ability between movements.

It affect their quality of life drastically and millions of seniors are diagnosed with PD every year worldwide. Several models have been presented earlier to detect the PD using various types of measurement data like speech, gait patterns, etc. Early identification of PD is important owing to the fact that the patient can offer important details which helps in slowing down the progress of PD. The recently-emerging Deep Learning (DL) models can leverage the past data to detect and classify PD. With this motivation, the current study develops a novel Colliding Bodies Optimization Algorithm with Optimal Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (CBO-OKELM) for diagnosis and classification of PD.

CBO-OKELM technique involves the design of Colliding Bodies Optimization-based Feature Selection (CBO-FS) technique for optimal subset of features. In addition, Water Strider Algorithm (WSA) with Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) model is also developed for the classification of PD. CBO algorithm is used to elect the optimal set of features whereas WSA is utilized for parameter tuning of KELM model which altogether helps in accomplishing the maximum PD diagnostic performance.

Many flames that are of interest to scientists and engineers are turbulent and thus inherently three-dimensional, especially in practical combustors, which often contain multiple interacting flames. Fortunately, combustion leads to the emission of light, both spontaneously and in response to laser-based stimulation. Therefore, images of a flame convey path-integrated information about the source of light, and a tomography algorithm can be used to reconstruct the spatial distribution of the light source, called emission tomography. In a carefully designed experiment, reconstructions can be post-processed using chemical kinetic, spectroscopic, and/or transport models to extract quantitative information. This information can be invaluable for benchmarking numerical solutions, and volumetric emission tomography is increasingly relied upon to paint a more complete picture of combustion than point, linear, or planar tools. Steady reductions in the cost of optical equipment and computing power, improvements in imaging technology, and advances in reconstruction algorithms have enabled a suite of three-dimensional sensors that are regularly used to characterize combustion. Four emission modalities are considered in this review: chemiluminescence, laser-induced fluorescence, passive incandescence, and laser-induced incandescence. The review covers the reconstruction algorithms, imaging models, camera calibration techniques, signal physics, instrumentation, and post-processing methods needed to conduct volumetric emission tomography and interpret the results. Limitations of each method are discussed and a survey of key applications is presented. The future of volumetric combustion diagnostics is considered, with special attention paid to the advent and promise of machine learning as well as spectrally-resolved volumetric measurement techniques. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Chemiluminescence; Combustion diagnostics; Fluorescence; Incandescence; Tomography; Volumetric imaging,Review,Scopus

The support vector machine (SVM) mechanism is specifically employed for building an artificial intelligence (AI) assistant diagnosis systems. Considering the practical demands on clinical diagnosis, the plain SVM algorithm is hardly used since the poor number of classes (typically, two classes) and explosion of samples. Therefore, a sample domain description technology is developed to realize a one-class SVM for flexibly expending the number of classes. Furthermore, a constantly online learning strategy is proposed to implement high-performance classification/diagnosis with greatly reduced database. For proof-of-concept, several medical databases are employed for diagnosis test. From the test results, the diagnosis correct rate is improved with compact database; and the scale of database is reduced while the similar correct rate is achieved by plain SVM algorithm. Maintaining the best accuracy, the proposed online learning SVM reduces the numbers of active samples (support vectors) to 23.4 %, 54.6 %, 70.9 % of the plain for diagnosing the breast cancer, diabetes, and liver disorders, respectively, where the best accuracy is superior or similar to state-of-the-arts. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Data domain description; Medical data; Online learning; SVM,Conference Paper,Scopus

It consists of a series of modules; data preprocessing, data normalization, data split and finally classification or prediction by the RF classifier. The preprocessed data is normalized using minmax normalization often used before model fitting. As the input data or variables are measured at different scales, it is necessary to normalize them to contribute equally to the model fitting. Then, the RF classifier is employed for course selection which is an ensemble learning method and k-fold cross-validation (k = 10) is used to validate the model. The proposed Prediction Model for Course Selection (PMCS) system is considered a multi-class problem that predicts the course for a particular learner with three complexity levels, namely low, medium and high. It is operated under two modes; locally and globally. The former considers the gender of the learner and the later does not consider the gender of the learner. The database comprises the learner opinions from 75 males and 75 females per category (low, medium and high). Thus the system uses a total of 450 samples to evaluate the performance of the PMCS system. Results show that the system's performance, while using locally i.e., gender-wise has slightly higher performance than the global system. The RF classifier with 75 decision trees in the global system provides an average accuracy of 97.6%, whereas in the local system it is 97% (male) and 97.6% (female). The overall performance of the RF classifier with 75 trees is better than 25, 50 and 100 decision trees in both local and global systems. © 2023 CRL Publishing.

In this work, a novel method for automated seizure identification from the EEG signal is proposed utilizing the sparse common spatial pattern (sCSP) and the adaptive short-time Fourier transform-based synchrosqueezing transform (adaptive FSST). The sCSP is utilized to select optimal channels and discriminate seizure states. In order to enhance the time–frequency representation of multi-component EEG signals and reduce noise and interferences, the selected channels are imported into adaptive FSST. The frequency spectrum of the adaptive FSST is separated into distinct segments concentrated on a particular frequency to improve seizure detection by adapting the EEG signal decomposition to the rhythmic component of seizures. Thus, a simple linear classifier is all that is needed to identify seizures thanks to this collection of algorithms since the extracted features from each segment's instantaneous amplitude and frequency and logvariance of each selected channel could be highly discriminative. Using linear classifiers for these discriminative features avoids overfitting and training complexity inherent in most non-linear classifiers and deep learning approaches. The proposed approach is compared to previous high-performance algorithms using the CHB-MIT epileptic EEG database.

As the attainment of quantum supremacy demonstrates, quantum computers have already outpaced classical computers in certain domains (Arute et al. in Nature 574:505–510, 2019 [3]). The study of quantum computation is becoming increasingly relevant in today’s world. A field in which quantum computing may be applied is adversarial machine learning. A step toward better understanding quantum computing applied to adversarial machine learning has been taken recently by Lu et al. (Phys Rev Res 2:1–18, 2020 [13]), who have shown that gradient-based adversarial attacks can be transferred from classical to quantum neural networks. Inspired by Lu et al. (Phys Rev Res 2:1–18, 2020 [13]), we investigate the existence of the transferability of adversarial examples between different neural networks and the implications of that transferability. We find that, when the fast gradient sign attacks, as described by Goodfellow et al. (Explaining and harnessing adversarial examples. arXiv preprint arXiv:1412.6572 [9]), is applied to a quantum neural network, the adversarially perturbed images produced with that method have transferability between quantum neural networks and from quantum to classical neural networks. In other words, adversarial images produced to deceive a quantum neural network can also deceive other quantum and classical neural networks. The results demonstrate that there exists transferability of adversarial examples in quantum machine learning. This transferability suggests a similarity in the decision boundaries of the different models, which may be an important subject of future study in quantum machine learning theory. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Black box attack; Classical neural network; Fast gradient sign method; Quantum adversarial machine learning; Quantum neural network; Transfer attack,Conference Paper,Scopus

Aiming at the unique structure of the transfer network in which the dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) is responsible for time sequence expansion, a genetic learning algorithm with a two-step strategy and an adaptive mechanism is proposed. This paper proposes a genetic algorithm with a two-step strategy and an adaptive mechanism to realize the adaptation of crossover rate and mutation rate, and uses different strategies for different evolution stages in mutation and crossover operations. The improved adaptive genetic algorithm (IAGA) based on DBN is proposed and implemented.

One disadvantage of purely data-driven approaches is that they tend to perform poorly in regions outside the original training domain. To mitigate this limitation, physical knowledge about the structure can be embedded in the model architecture via the model topology or numerical constraints in the formulation. For large-scale systems, relevant physics, such as the system-state matrices, may be expensive to compute. One way around this problem is to use scalar functionals, such as energy, to constrain the network to operate within physical bounds. We propose a neural network framework based on Hamiltonian mechanics to enforce a physics-informed structure to the model. The Hamiltonian framework allows us to relate the energy of the system to the measured quantities (e.g., accelerations) through the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion. In this work, the potential, kinetic energy, and Rayleigh damping terms are each modeled with a multilayer perceptron. Auto-differentiation is used to compute partial derivatives and assemble all the relevant equations, including computing the generalized inertia matrix by forming the Hessian of the kinetic energy with respect to the generalized coordinates. Moreover, a Bayesian approach is used to estimate model-form error to predict domain shifts in the data and enable model correction. The network incorporates a numerics-informed loss function via the residual of a multistep integration term, allowing the ensemble of networks to be time-integrated with new initial conditions and an arbitrary external force after it has been trained. The approach is demonstrated on simple exemplars, such as a two degree-of-freedom (DOF) damped oscillator with cubic nonlinearities. © 2023, The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc.",Euler-Lagrange; Hamiltonian mechanics; Neural networks; Nonlinear dynamics,Conference Paper,Scopus

To assign defenders to attackers properly so that the survivability of the aircraft is maximized, a multi-objective Dynamic Weapon Target Assignment (DWTA) model is developed. The objectives include: the hit probability of each defender, the miss distance of each defender, the final speed of each defender, and the distance between the aircraft and the attacker when the attacker is intercepted. These objectives are various and can be calculated based on the given flight states. Machine learning algorithms are used to predict these objectives so that the computational runtime is improved.

In engineering mechanics, events may result from non-smoothness in the form of loss of contact, impact, or the onset of sliding-friction. An interesting example of such a mechanical system is a wheel whose center of mass does not coincide with its geometric center. An eccentric wheel may evolve in three distinct phases: roll without slip, roll with slip, and hop. Therefore, this paper seeks to explore and compare supervised learning methods for phase identification (i.e., roll, slip, and hop) in simulated data from a driven eccentric wheel. The mechanics of a torque driven wheel on a flat surface are derived through an augmented Lagrangian formulation and Coulomb friction is adopted to model transverse contact forces. To accommodate for non-smoothness, the system is broken down in complementary sub-problems and the simulation is conducted using event-based methods.

Surfactant huff-puff treatment is mostly applied for this purpose and the resulting surfactant performance is the outcome of complex interfacial processes. Currently, the effect of important parameters on surfactant performance is not completely reported and the contribution of each parameter to surfactant performance is hard to be quantified. Traditional methods to optimize surfactant performance are time-consuming and show strong dependency on extensive experiments. In this paper, we address these problems from machine learning (ML) perspectives. Several ML models are established to predict surfactant performance and Random Forest (RF) model presents better accuracy. Based on RF model, we apply Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) approach to interpret modeling results to obtain new insights and provide solutions to unsolved problems. Results show that when interfacial tension is lower than a critical value or oil API gravity is higher than a critical value, surfactant performance shows obvious improvements. In general, porosity, permeability, and surfactant concentration are positively associated with surfactant performance. The trend becomes less obvious when parameter value exceeds a certain level. In addition, SHAP value could effectively decompose surfactant performance into individual effect of each parameter. This analysis is valuable to indicate certain parameters to be optimized. It is shown that surfactant concentration in a proportion of samples is kept in a low level and complete wettability alteration is not achieved. To optimize surfactant concentration, an innovative procedure integrating RF prediction model with Powell's method is proposed. This procedure is effective to avoid deficient and superabundant surfactant concentration. With optimization, the average surfactant concentration is increased from 0.37 wt% to 0.93 wt%. The average probability of high-oil-recovery class is improved from 0.38 to 0.50. The incremental oil recovery is improved from low-oil-recovery class to high-oil-recovery class. Our work promotes the understanding of wettability alteration by surfactants and provides a fast framework to predict, analyze, and optimize surfactant performance. This framework could greatly save experiment time and cost. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Carbonate reservoirs; Machine learning; Spontaneous imbibition test; Surfactant huff-puff design; Wettability alteration,Article,Scopus

To do that, a large number of sensors are deployed on the production lines. However, in harsh chemical production environment, such as strong acid and high temperature, certain variables are very difficult to measure, since the corresponding sensors are costly and prone to failure. To address this challenge, we propose a cooperative sensorless perception approach to estimate hard-to-measure variables by exploring the correlation and regression among the estimated variables with the other easy-to-measure variables of the production line. Specifically, the production data is pre-processed through correlation analysis and data cleaning, which brings a valuable data set for modeling. Furthermore, a regression model based on random forest is built to forecast the targeted variables. We have verified our methodology in the practical AlF3 production lines in a chemical company. Experiment results show that the accuracy of predicted results is higher than 95%, which verifies that the proposed method is feasible and reliable. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Cooperative perception; Machine learning; Random forest; Sensors,Conference Paper,Scopus

This family of approaches utilizes a series of responses of the full-order model to assemble a suitable basis, subsequently employed to formulate a set of equivalent, low-order equations through projection. However, in a nonlinear setting, physics-based ROMs require an additional approximation to circumvent the bottleneck of projecting and evaluating the nonlinear contributions on the reduced space. This scheme is termed hyper-reduction and enables substantial computational time reduction. The aforementioned hyper-reduction scheme implies a trade-off, relying on a necessary sacrifice on the accuracy of the nonlinear terms’ mapping to achieve rapid or even real-time evaluations of the ROM framework. Since time is essential, especially for digital twins representations in structural health monitoring applications, the hyper-reduction approximation serves as both a blessing and a curse. Our work scrutinizes the possibility of exploiting machine learning (ML) tools in place of hyper-reduction to derive more accurate surrogates of the nonlinear mapping. By retaining the POD-based reduction and introducing the machine learning-boosted surrogate(s) directly on the reduced coordinates, we aim to substitute the projection and update process of the nonlinear terms when integrating forward in time on the low-order dimension. Our approach explores a proof-of-concept case study based on a Nonlinear Auto-regressive neural network with eXogenous Inputs (NARX-NN), trying to potentially derive a superior physics-based ROM in terms of efficiency, suitable for (near) real-time evaluations.

However, the method is restricted to structures with linear behaviour, and application of traditional methods in structures with nonlinearities yields results that do not typically have the desired characteristics of modal analysis. In the current work, a machine learning approach to performing nonlinear modal analysis is proposed. The idea is motivated by the Shaw–Pierre definition of nonlinear normal modes. The machine learning algorithm used is the cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (cycle-GAN). The algorithm provides a forward and inverse mapping between two spaces, which in the current application are the physical coordinate space and the modal space of the studied structures. Together with the cycle-GAN, an assembly of neural networks is used to tune the mappings so that they are angle-preserving (conformal) mappings; in this way, the orthogonality of the mode shapes is imposed during training. A criterion with a view to selecting the best model between the training epochs of the neural networks, based on the decomposition of the modes in the power spectral densities of the modal coordinates, is also introduced. The algorithm is tested on two simulated systems with cubic nonlinearities and different degrees of freedom. Moreover, it is tested on data recorded from an experimental structure, which has a harsh nonlinearity (impact nonlinearity). The results of the applications reveal that the algorithm is able to efficiently provide a decomposition of the modes in terms of the power spectral densities of the modal coordinates, provide an inverse mapping (from the modal space back to the natural coordinates), which is an essential part of modal analysis, and also provide modal coordinates that are statistically largely uncorrelated. The proposed approach seems to outperform previous approaches compared to both the decomposition provided and the definition of the inverse mapping. © 2023, The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc.",Cycle-GAN; Generative adversarial networks (GANs); Inductive biases; Machine learning; Nonlinear modal analysis,Conference Paper,Scopus

While these are beneficial, current musculoskeletal models lack the ability to give insight into the mechanical stimuli required to prevent physiological deconditioning (i.e., muscle atrophy, bone decalcification, and poor cardiovascular health). This is seen on the International Space Station (ISS) as astronauts still experience deconditioning symptoms even with strict exercise regimes. Therefore, this study overviews the development of a multidimensional surface interpolation, which uses a radial basis function derived from the proper orthogonal decomposition). Inputs to the interpolation scheme are biomechanical responses found by solving an inverse dynamic problem using the ISS’s Advanced Resistive Exercise Device model and simulation within OpenSim. A comparison of 41 lower extremity muscle forces between the interpolation and the static optimization analysis in OpenSim was made. Results highlighted a 1.30% average deviation, with errors concentrated at fluctuating data regions in the minimum force production category.

The investigation of data stream by the use of machine learning (ML) approaches to address regression, prediction, and classification problems have received considerable interest. At the same time, the detection of anomalies or outliers and feature selection (FS) processes becomes important. This study develops an outlier detection with feature selection technique for streaming data classification, named ODFST-SDC technique. Initially, streaming data is pre-processed in two ways namely categorical encoding and null value removal. In addition, Local Correlation Integral (LOCI) is used which is significant in the detection and removal of outliers. Besides, red deer algorithm (RDA) based FS approach is employed to derive an optimal subset of features. Finally, kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) classifier is used for streaming data classification. The design of LOCI based outlier detection and RDA based FS shows the novelty of the work. In order to assess the classification outcomes of the ODFST-SDC technique, a series of simulations were performed using three benchmark datasets. The experimental results reported the promising outcomes of the ODFST-SDC technique over the recent approaches. © 2023, Tech Science Press.

Significant advances in IoT networks have been hindered by security vulnerabilities and threats, which, if not addressed, can negatively impact the deployment and operation of IoT-enabled systems. This article addresses IoT security and presents an intelligent two-layer intrusion detection system for IoT. The system's intelligence is driven by machine learning techniques for intrusion detection, with the two-layer architecture handling flow-based and packet-based features. By selecting significant features, the time overhead is minimized without affecting detection accuracy. The uniqueness and novelty of the proposed system emerge from combining machine learning and selection modules for flow-based and packet-based features. The proposed intrusion detection works at the network layer, and hence, it is device and application transparent. In our experiments, the proposed system had an accuracy of 99.15% for packet-based features with a testing time of 0.357 ?s. The flow-based classifier had an accuracy of 99.66% with a testing time of 0.410 ?s. A comparison demonstrated that the proposed system outperformed other methods described in the literature.

Knowledge fusion technology can effectively integrate knowledge from different sources, thereby improving the accuracy and richness of the knowledge graph, which is of great significance to the sustainable development of smart EMS. Traditional machine learning methods on graphs face challenges in the fusion of complex and multirelational enterprise knowledge graphs due to inherent defects in relation semantic and local structure information capturing. In order to break through these limitations and improve EMS knowledge graphs, we propose tensor-based graph attention networks for multirelational graph representation learning (MR-GAT), and apply it to the critical tasks in knowledge fusion: Entity and relation alignment. Specifically, we innovatively adopt tensor operations to adequately model the interactions between entities and relations in EMS knowledge graph to learn more accurate representations. Additionally, we propose a relation attention mechanism, which focuses on assigning weights in the process of aggregating local semantic information for relation learning in an EMS knowledge graph. Furthermore, we develop a joint entity and relation alignment framework by utilizing the proposed multirelational graph attention networks to improve the accuracy of knowledge fusion. Experimental evaluations on three datasets present that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline models by about 1.4% on average in terms of the mean reciprocal rank metric, which demonstrates the superior ability of the proposed MR-GAT in representation learning for knowledge fusion in smart EMS. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",Augmented Intelligence of Things (AIoT); entity alignment; graph neural networks (GNN); knowledge graph; machine learning technology on graphs; smart enterprise management systems (EMS),Article,Scopus

The thermogravimetric experiments of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) were conducted from 105 °C to 900 °C at different heating rates (10 °C/min, 20 °C/min, and 30 °C/min) to investigate their thermal pyrolysis behavior. We investigated four methods including three model-free methods and one model-fitting method to estimate dynamic parameters. Additionally, an artificial neural network model was developed by providing the heating rates and temperatures to predict the weight loss (wt.%) of HDPE, and optimized via assessing mean squared error and determination coefficient on the test set. The optimal MSE (2.6297 × 10?2) and R2 value (R2 &gt; 0.999) were obtained. Activation energy and pre-exponential factor obtained from four different models achieves the acceptable value between experimental and predicted results. The relative error of the model increased from 2.4 % to 6.8 % when the sampling frequency changed from 50 s to 60 s, but showed no significant difference when the sampling frequency was below 50 s. This result provides a promising approach to simplify the further modelling work and to reduce the required data storage space. This study revealed the possibility of simulating the HDPE pyrolysis process via machine learning with no significant accuracy loss of the kinetic parameters. It is hoped that this work could potentially benefit to the development of pyrolysis process modelling of HDPE and the other plastics.

An electroencephalogram (EEG) can be used to identify cognitive load during mental arithmetic activities. EEG data was collected from public databases such as the mental arithmetic task (MAT) and simultaneous task workload (STEW). In this manuscript, short-term EEG signals were used to detect cognitive load. Circulant singular spectrum analysis (C-SSA) was used to decompose the EEG signals into intrinsic mode functions (IMF's). After that, we extract the entropy based features from the IMF's. For feature selection, optimization algorithms were used, namely Binary Grey Wolf Optimization (BGWO), Binary Harris Hawks Optimization (BHH0), and Binary Differential Evolution (BDE). Furthermore, supervised machine learning methods, namely K-nearest neighbour (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM), were employed to classify selected features based on performance metrics like accuracy (ACC %), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), precision (PRE), and F-Score (F-S). C-SSA for decomposition and optimization algorithms for feature selection are novel techniques for cognitive load detection. The proposed BHHO-KNN technique achieves the best classification accuracy of 96.88% and 95.28%, individually, for the STEW and MAT datasets. The conclusions of the experiments showed that the proposed technique is more precise at detecting cognitive load compared to existing methods. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","C-SSA; Cognitive load; EEG; Machine learning; Optimization algorithms: BGWO, BHHO, and BDE",Article,Scopus

Based on the value mining of multiple data sources such as KPI/XDR/MDT, it closely integrates the traditional interference source investigation process and big data/machine learning Technology. At the same time, combined with BPNN neural network, the interference source and interference type can be identified intelligently. By using the BFL boundary point fitting algorithm, the interference source can be detected, classified and simulated. At the same time, a set of interference source overall optimization scheme is given. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Classification; Interference source; MDT; Simulation location; Troubleshoot,Conference Paper,Scopus

To ensure the safety of the system operation, the fault detection of servo systems is very important. Servo system fault detection often uses comparative differential judgment method, which requires the establishment of a reliable model. On the one hand, servo system models are usually built using mathematical and physical methods by combining the transfer functions of the various components the actual servo system have into an algorithm that calculates the input–output relationship. On the other hand, machine learning algorithms can also be used to model the servo system. In this paper, we address this issue by developing a rocket data prediction model based on the LSTM algorithm using publicly available data provided by Shanghai Aerospace Control Technology Institute. After deriving the results, the results are evaluated by using R-squared metrics and some improvement outlooks are provided for the subsequent research. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Fault detection; LSTM; Machine learning,Conference Paper,Scopus
